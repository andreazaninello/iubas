If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"\n\nYeah, the subroutine thing is what I've been trying to explain as well. First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you. If it tells you that x stops, then P(x) won't stop, and if it tells you that x doesn't stop, then P(x) stops.\n\nThis thing, one instruction list telling you to do another instruction list, is what a sub-routine is.\n\nSo far so good?"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "I understand--I think--that H(a,b) could be a list of instructions.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"\n\nYeah, the subroutine thing is what I've been trying to explain as well. First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you. If it tells you that x stops, then P(x) won't stop, and if it tells you that x doesn't stop, then P(x) stops.\n\nThis thing, one instruction list telling you to do another instruction list, is what a sub-routine is.\n\nSo far so good?"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "I understand--I think--that H(a,b) could be a list of instructions.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\".

In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it.

The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you.

For instance, if I'm designing a website, I don't need to know how the quantum physics of computer chips works, I can just trust the lower layers to take care of that for me. So, lets start at the top and work our way down:\n\nTop Layer\n\nContent: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.\n\nProgram: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language. These are typically \"high level\" languages, meaning they have advanced tools that let you do many things at once. For instance, you might write an instruction like \"If (comment_length &gt; 40000) : return error.\" That's pretty readable to a human, but requires quite a lot of work \"under the hood\" for the computer.\n\nMachine Code: This is the code your CPU actually runs. You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute. This consists of much simpler instructions like \n    \n    Connect register 1 to the A side of the ALU\n    \n    Connect register 7 to the B side of the ALU\n    \n    Set the ALU to perform two's-complement addition\n    \n    Set the ALU's carry input to zero\n    \n    Store the result value in register 8\n\nthis machine code is directly accessing the data stored in 2 memory registers and adding them, storing the result in a 3rd register.\n\nPhysical Layer: This is what we were talking about earlier, circuits that can turn each other on and off, connected in complex ways. Ultimately, computers are switches (transistors) connected to storage devices through complicated networks that correspond to simple calculations, comparing 2 numbers, adding them, reversing, copying, etc. But its all just patterns of ON and OFF, 1 and 0.

So, lets start at the top and work our way down:\n\nTop Layer\n\nContent: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.\n\nProgram: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language. These are typically \"high level\" languages, meaning they have advanced tools that let you do many things at once. For instance, you might write an instruction like \"If (comment_length &gt; 40000) : return error.\" That's pretty readable to a human, but requires quite a lot of work \"under the hood\" for the computer.\n\nMachine Code: This is the code your CPU actually runs. You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute. This consists of much simpler instructions like \n    \n    Connect register 1 to the A side of the ALU\n    \n    Connect register 7 to the B side of the ALU\n    \n    Set the ALU to perform two's-complement addition\n    \n    Set the ALU's carry input to zero\n    \n    Store the result value in register 8\n\nthis machine code is directly accessing the data stored in 2 memory registers and adding them, storing the result in a 3rd register.\n\nPhysical Layer: This is what we were talking about earlier, circuits that can turn each other on and off, connected in complex ways. Ultimately, computers are switches (transistors) connected to storage devices through complicated networks that correspond to simple calculations, comparing 2 numbers, adding them, reversing, copying, etc. But its all just patterns of ON and OFF, 1 and 0.

If you invest in yen and try to use it in another country, it is very likely most places will not accept the currency unless you are willing to trade at a decent or significant loss. So that investment makes no sense because it is unusable until converted, which requires a person willing to trade it. \n\nFurthermore, from another comment, someone said that money is useless until spent, which I fully agree with.

The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run. If I say something like x = M(y), that means I took the value y, put it into M's memory, allowed it to run, and then once it's done take the resulting stuff in memory and put it into x.\n\n*Quines*\n\nTo simplify the structure, I'm going to use the existence of a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\\)) - a computer that prints its own source code. The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.\n\nSo, if I did something like this:\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYCODE()\n      PRINT(x)\n    }\n\nIt would print out\n    x = GETMYCODE()\n    PRINT(x)\n\n*'Weak' Halting Problem*\n\nI'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have. The more general form is \"Is there a computer which, when given some source code and an input value, can determine whether that code will halt when given that input?\". I'm going to ask a narrower question \"Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?\"\n\nIt turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.\n\n**The Proof**\n\nWe want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.\n\nSo, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nSo, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYOWNCODE()\n      answer = H(x)\n      if answer is \"true\", loop\n      otherwise, halt\n    }\n\nAnd let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is \"true\", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).\n\nNow, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider.

When we run M, it gives H its own source code, and uses the output of H to decide whether it should halt or loop forever.

In that case, when we run M, it will end up immediately halting.\n\nAgain, this H is not a halting decider for this M.\n\nWhat we've shown is that H can't be a halting decider for this M.

Once we construct a physical computer to run stuff on, it can take the source code (a piece of text) and execute it, at which point it is a running program. This action of executing the code is the transition from text into running program. This is what happens when you open something on your computer. It retrieves some data from the disk, and then the CPU goes through that data step by step, performing the real actions that the data was describing.\n\nIn this proof, that's all that happens. I have the two pieces of code H and M. M was specially constructed by me, and uses a copy of the code of H inside of itself. When *I* run H(&lt;M&gt;) and M(), I'm doing the equivalent of opening them on my computer, and in the case of H giving it some text as input. When *M* runs H inside of itself, it is merely a transition into the part of M that I copied from H.

The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run. If I say something like x = M(y), that means I took the value y, put it into M's memory, allowed it to run, and then once it's done take the resulting stuff in memory and put it into x.\n\n*Quines*\n\nTo simplify the structure, I'm going to use the existence of a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\\)) - a computer that prints its own source code. The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.\n\nSo, if I did something like this:\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYCODE()\n      PRINT(x)\n    }\n\nIt would print out\n    x = GETMYCODE()\n    PRINT(x)\n\n*'Weak' Halting Problem*\n\nI'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have. The more general form is \"Is there a computer which, when given some source code and an input value, can determine whether that code will halt when given that input?\". I'm going to ask a narrower question \"Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?\"\n\nIt turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.\n\n**The Proof**\n\nWe want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.\n\nSo, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nSo, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYOWNCODE()\n      answer = H(x)\n      if answer is \"true\", loop\n      otherwise, halt\n    }\n\nAnd let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is \"true\", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).\n\nNow, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider. Or rephrased, there is no halting decider."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Thank you for this alternate proof--I'm having significant difficulty moving through it, but that may be because of all of the new concepts it introduces and the fact that I know nothing about programming and don't know how to read most pseudo-code.\n\nCan you explain what printing its own source code means?

So, let's do that - we run H(&lt;M&gt;). What happens if it says \"true\"?\n\nM was constructed to have the source code of H as a component in itself, so it can use H while running. When we run M, it gives H its own source code, and uses the output of H to decide whether it should halt or loop forever. In this case, H said \"true\", so M is going to loop forever.\n\nSo, this particular H is not a halting decider for this M. Perhaps it analyzes M for something else, or perhaps it just says something random, but it's definitely not a halting decider.\n\nSo, let's give H another chance - maybe it actually says \"false\" for this M. In that case, when we run M, it will end up immediately halting.\n\nAgain, this H is not a halting decider for this M.\n\nWhat we've shown is that H can't be a halting decider for this M.

Once we construct a physical computer to run stuff on, it can take the source code (a piece of text) and execute it, at which point it is a running program. This action of executing the code is the transition from text into running program. This is what happens when you open something on your computer. It retrieves some data from the disk, and then the CPU goes through that data step by step, performing the real actions that the data was describing.\n\nIn this proof, that's all that happens. I have the two pieces of code H and M. M was specially constructed by me, and uses a copy of the code of H inside of itself. When *I* run H(&lt;M&gt;) and M(), I'm doing the equivalent of opening them on my computer, and in the case of H giving it some text as input. When *M* runs H inside of itself, it is merely a transition into the part of M that I copied from H.

I teach five year olds. (XD) So if we assume the singularity has occurred already, then we must have found out more about consciousness than we already know. It\u2019s difficult to say whether the biological brain is more than the sum of input/output of information, motor control, and interpretation/ production of chemicals meant to drive the body towards a particular evolutionarily beneficial behavior. If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we\u2019d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I\u2019m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of... Could we call it a species? Could we call it intelligent? Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call \u201call too human\u201d which have plagued us for as long as we have been? With no space for subconsciousness or biases, with no ego, and with the ability to process information exponentially faster than the creatures which came before, with unlimited access to information, and the capability to increase storage space AS DESIRED, would there even be anything left to strive for? Oh, Timmy, I may have gotten a little bit existential. It wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nVery tough to make a call there. \n1. The new being is most likely it\u2019s own category now. What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature\u2019s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new \u201cspecies\u201d would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. \n\n2. If we kind of upgrade the existing frame with a new engine, a more modern dashboard, etc. then it\u2019s 100% the same species, in the same evolutionary chain.\n\n3. The reason I say new category in #1 is\u2014 what do people consider their deity/deities right now? Deity is not the best word here, but regardless of personal beliefs/truths about the beginnings of life, we would 100% be creators. Can you consider a creator to be of the same species? \n\nEh bottom line for me, Timmy.

In order to escape the well, you need the ladder, which is outside, problem is, in order to get the ladder you need to be outside, so there is no possible way, right?

Without going too much in to chemistry they have properties that make them more likely to be inert: f.i they have a decent number of electrons in their orbitals. They neither want to give away orbitals nor add any, they are content. Other elements might have 6 electrons when they *Really* want to have 8. Another might have 10. Those two elements might chemically interact, one giving away two electrons to the other so both are happy. Noble gases already are happy, so they don't feel a need to interact with other elements. \n\n&gt;  Is that the end goal of this world? \n\nNo. Assuming you're not religious, the world has no goal. It will get darker, colder, stars will die out one by one, and then an eternity of nothing. \n\n&gt; could there eventually be a life-form made of radon\n\nWhile I can't say it's impossible it's unlikely. The reason carbon based lifeforms are so succsessful is because carbon is *really* versatile. It reacts to a lot of things in a lot of very useful ways.

The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the\u00a0Big Bang, through the process called\u00a0Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75%\u00a0hydrogen, 24%\u00a0helium\u00a0by mass. The rest is traces of other elements such as\u00a0lithium\u00a0and the hydrogen\u00a0isotope\u00a0deuterium. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.\n\nHeavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to\u00a0fuse\u00a0light elements to heavier ones in their\u00a0cores, giving off energy in the process, known as\u00a0stellar nucleosynthesis. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including\u00a0iron\u00a0and\u00a0nickel, and these elements are ejected into space (the\u00a0interstellar medium) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as\u00a0white dwarfs. The remains of their ejected mass form the\u00a0planetary nebulae\u00a0observable throughout our galaxy.\n\nSupernova nucleosynthesis\u00a0within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between\u00a0magnesium\u00a0(atomic number 12) and\u00a0nickel\u00a0(atomic number 28).[1]\u00a0Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a\u00a0type II supernova\u00a0event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic process) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the\u00a0r-process) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.\n\nNeutron star mergers\u00a0and collisions are also very responsible for many heavy elements, via the\u00a0r-process\u00a0(\"r\" stands for \"rapid\"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of\u00a0supernovae, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed\u00a0neutrons. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of\u00a0GW170817\u00a0led to the detection of substantial signatures of\u00a0gold,\u00a0platinum\u00a0and other heavy elements over an extended period.\n\nCosmic ray spallation, caused when\u00a0cosmic rays\u00a0impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly\u00a03He,\u00a09Be and\u00a010,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via\u00a0radiogenesis\u00a0(decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called\u00a0cosmogenic nuclides.\""}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bz6395/eli5_in_chemistry_why_are_they_called_the_noble/", "post_id": "bz6395"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: How Going Vegan Will Save The Environment"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Farming animals on the scales we do uses a vast amount of resources - feed, water, electricity, fuel.

Eventually, we won\u2019t be able to use antibiotics anymore because there will be super strains of bacteria. \n\nLots of people believe that the things we vaccinate against now, which have killed people in days gone by, we could treat with modern medicine, but most things we vaccinate against are viruses, which aren\u2019t affected by antibiotics, and in most cases you just have to treat the symptoms and hope for the best.

Since it's nano particles it passes completely through the cells of your liver, kidneys etc and so it passes out with the waste like anything else and never gets trapped. Particles that get trapped cause blueing of the skin and that's basically what Glenn Beck did to \"disprove\" it's usefulness. He used topical silver Wich isn't nano and it got trapped in his body and cause his nose to litteraly turn deep blue. \n\nIf used properly, I still don't recommend using it every single day or more than is suggested on the lable because after a few weeks it messes with the bacteria in your gut and you gotta balance it out with probiotics.

If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we\u2019d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I\u2019m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of...

Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call \u201call too human\u201d which have plagued us for as long as we have been?

What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature\u2019s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new \u201cspecies\u201d would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. \n\n2.

Just because you are a side character doesnt mean you dont get development. Thats a double standard (i think i used that term correctly). Its the same for a main character. Just because you are a main character doesnt mean you will always get development.\n\nRather than looking at the characters importance in the story first, i think acknowledging they are a character first, and a main character second is better. After youve acknowledged that you are looking at a character that might or might not be a main character, you should look at the characters complexity. And then after that, you should look at the characters importance and how that ties to the characters complexity and relationship to the plot.\n\nAlso on the topic of stereotypes, yes they usually are boring, repetitive and lacking in character development, i often see characters that follow a stereotype to the t and still be amazing characters. Sometimes its because they fill a stereotype they are great characters. Sometimes the stereotype is just a bonus to an already great character. \n\nSummary: First, although your summary is sometimes correct, that doesnt make it true for all stories.

Third, characters are characters before they are stereotypes and characters can have development even if they are stereotypes. \n\nSummary for my summary (bc i realized that its way too long and also bc im like that) : Characters are characters before they are anything, before they are main characters, side characters, stereotypes, etc. And all characters can have a different amount of dimensions based on their complexity."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "A side character is entirely different from an extra.

My explaination is based off the assumption that people will usually care more about characters that have more development. Its also based off the assumption that *usually* more important characters will usually have more complexity meaning complex characters are often main characters (but *not always*). The dimensions of a character is solely based off the complexity of a character.
