&gt;That doesn't change the fact that in this video the shadow is higher in the sky and somehow, underneath it, closer to behind the earth, where the shadow should be, there is no shadow.
The shadow is exactly behind the Earth. 
How it appears from an arbitrary point above the surface of the Earth remains entirely irrelevant. 
&gt;It shouldn't matter what the leading edge of the moon is.
It does. 
&gt;It matters where the shadow is. 
Which is just ahead of the Moon in its orbit, leading to the leading edge mattering.  
&gt;Even if the moon is actually orbiting in that direction,
What do you mean ""if""? Have you not even bothered verifying what I've been telling you?
&gt;then the shadow should still appear on the side closest to behind the earth.
It does. 
&gt;It makes 0 logical sense. 
It makes 1 logical sense, you're just too obsessed with your own opinions to see it. 
&gt;If I get a light source a tennis ball and a golf ball, no matter what way I arrange them, it just won't work like that.
Again, what do you mean ""if""? Get them, and a needle to stick in the tennis ball at the terminator to represent the position of the camera.

Top Layer
Content: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.
Program: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language. These are typically ""high level"" languages, meaning they have advanced tools that let you do many things at once. For instance, you might write an instruction like ""If (comment_length &gt; 40000) : return error.""

Machine Code: This is the code your CPU actually runs. You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute. This consists of much simpler instructions like 
    
    Connect register 1 to the A side of the ALU
    
    Connect register 7 to the B side of the ALU
    
    Set the ALU to perform two's-complement addition
    
    Set the ALU's carry input to zero
    
    Store the result value in register 8
this machine code is directly accessing the data stored in 2 memory registers and adding them, storing the result in a 3rd register.

GoldEdit
Chrysopoeia, the artificial production of gold, is the symbolic goal of alchemy. Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is currently many times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope, 197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.
Gold synthesis in an acceleratorEdit
Gold synthesis in a particle accelerator is possible in many ways. The Spallation Neutron Source has a liquid mercury target which will be transmuted into gold, platinum, and iridium, which are lower in atomic number than mercury.[citation needed]
Gold synthesis in a nuclear reactorEdit
Gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive.[12] In 1924, a Japanese physicist, Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.[13]
Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by the irradiation of either platinum or mercury."

**Setup**
*Notation*
Just to go over notation - all upper case things I write will represent a computer or subroutine of a computer. The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run.

The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.
So, if I did something like this:

*'Weak' Halting Problem*
I'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have.

I'm going to ask a narrower question ""Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?""
It turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.
**The Proof**
We want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.
So, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either ""true"" or ""false"".
So, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this
    M() {
      x = GETMYOWNCODE()
      answer = H(x)
      if answer is ""true"", loop
      otherwise, halt
    }
And let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is ""true"", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).
Now, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider.

Bear in mind though, that my question in regards to it is roughly this: 
If many of the elements, besides the most basic like hydrogen, formed in stars or supernovas, what sort of event would be required to make even more elements? 
For instance, if a star is an ""element factory"", what would an even more 'advanced' element factory look like in nature?

""Nucleosynthesis is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons(protons and neutrons).

Supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between magnesium (atomic number 12) and nickel (atomic number 28).[1] Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a type II supernova event.

Money in modern society is more or less fictional with limits placed arbitrarily to benefit one or another faction of the ruling class. Debt is the main way money is introduced into the economy and there would be no money circulating if all debts were paid, as far as I understand.
Some books that opened my eyes about this were David Graeber's Debt: The First Five Thousand Years and Kate Raworth's Donut Economics. I also like reading about Modern Monetary Theory which is based on some of these ideas -- although I don't agree with the thinking of all MMTers (and am certainly not smart enough to say that to their faces)."

Wel then it's not the same. How would you feel if the government put two strangers in your apartment?
&gt;I let homeless people sleep in the stairwell of my apartment building, when it is below zero and snowing outside. I give them tea and 
something to eat. 
You're a nice person, but why not put them in your apartment?
&gt;No
Then why not put them in your apartment?
&gt;No. See first answer.
Would you verify who they were if you were going to let them stay in your apartment for free forever?
&gt;No, that doesn’t fit the analogy because we can all see what is happening in Syria.
I can switch on the computer and see what's happening in the next town over, that doesn't make them my neighbours.
 &gt;The asylum process does involve verification. The thing is, we like to help keep them alive while the verification process is happening.

The Schwarzschild black hole is an approximation but that does not make it wrong. For many calculations the precision afforded by this approximation is close enough and you don’t need the extra complexity from considering rotation and charge. Schwarzschild knew exactly what he was describing and no one said that his model was a final explanation of all black holes.
So he completely ignored the merits of empirical science? And as a result thought that black holes formed from the death stars when literally the exact opposite was true, that they probably form as developing stars?

My explaination is based off the assumption that people will usually care more about characters that have more development. Its also based off the assumption that *usually* more important characters will usually have more complexity meaning complex characters are often main characters (but *not always*). The dimensions of a character is solely based off the complexity of a character. The characters importance can change the complexity as the author will focus more on that character (most of the time), but specifically the dimensions are based off the complexity of a character (which ive explained before and how you can sometimes measure the complexity of a character)."

Its like I can almost imagine it but not really. Unfortunately its really hard to explain for me."

If I want to make America eat fewer oranges, and levy an orange tax, Americans can easily respond by eating tangerines or grapefruits or mandarins.

Basic economics asserts that you can reduce consumption of a good if you raise the price, but in practice, it depends a great deal on what that good is. Take health care in the USA. The prices have been relentlessly rising, yet consumption of that suite of goods has not reduced at all. The critical issue is ""substitute goods"". If I want to make America eat fewer oranges, and levy an orange tax, Americans can easily respond by eating tangerines or grapefruits or mandarins. So the real question of the carbon tax is this, ""How viable are the substitute goods?"" The answer to that, for carbon, is complicated. In some cases, they're very viable, in others, not so much.
In the end, personally, I'm in favor of the carbon tax, because it's a non-prescriptive answer to how to reduce our emissions and (hopefully) achieve some ecological equilibrium. I don't think it will be perfect, because I don't believe in perfect policies or institutions, but I do think it's preferable to the status quo (doing nothing)."

And if a newborn Irish kid had been teleported to 1600 American continent, they\'d almost certainly die along with 90-95% of the Native American  inhabitants of the eastern US in the plague that occurred in that time and place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don\'t understand the need to go about arguing that we\'re all the same exact thing.

No one is arguing that a white person and a black person react the same to the sun. What they\'re saying is that the criteria that are ascribed to divide people into different groups are false; that the distinct categorizations of peoples into races does not reflect true biological differences. There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there\'s zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn\'t in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable. Change can be confusing and stressful so saying that this is just the way things are, and that the way I personally see the world is unambiguously, completely accurately, THE way the world IS, is comforting. \n\nBut there are a lot more genetic differences within a given race than between different races. Also, virtually all humans who are descended from people from outside sub-Saharan Africa are quite similar, as compared to the differences between any 2 people of different villages in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, modern humans, it seems, evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then a small subset of those people left Africa and populated the rest of the planet. All the differences you see among Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, etc., all come from this small subset of people that left Africa.  Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it\'s simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that\'s false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you\'d have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don\'t like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let\'s think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that\'s a bit weird because you\'re ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it\'s like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it\'s not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they\'re the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it\'s just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let\'s accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don\'t fall into distinct groups as if they\'re separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it\'s very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There\'s a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There\'s no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you\'re black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there\'s no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let\'s choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don\'t. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It\'s just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn\'t. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don\'t equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren\'t inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes.'}",| Why does the term 'race' only apply to humankind?,"&gt;The way I heard the disease story was that the immune systems of those European settlers was adapted to resisting the disease due to years of living in their agrarian society.

Race is an old concept based on scientific principles of the 19th century that helped science to get where it is today but that has been demonstrated to be false, much like Lamarckism was useful but now has been replaced by the theory of evolution."

It's not that DNA can't be repaired at all, it's that it is the ""master program"" for the cell and can be modified in ways that make the cell do things that it isn't supposed to. 
You can also receive too much damage to important cells like in organs. It's actually therapeutic in some situations, such as using radioactive iodine to destroy some of a large thyroid, but many organs are not good at regenerating so the damage can hamper their functionality."

Look into the technical definition of  'work' in a physics and/or thermodynamics sense. Basically, work means a transfer of energy over time. All work comes from a force acting on something moving over a distance in the same direction as the force.

In quantum physics, for example, particles constantly pop in and out of exsistence, depending on measurement.
There is no cause, it just is.  When we measure it, we can see its effects, but not it's cause.  We are catching it in progress, in exsistence, because it simply happens.
The same applies to the big bang.

Most people do more than 4 classes a term if they're full time. If you're in an experimental science, labs often run 3-4 hours once a week.
Most of my classes expected 2-4 hours of out of class time for every hour in class. Typical problem sets took 8-12 hours. If you have 4 classes, you're looking at 32-48 hours of homework a week on top of class time. Plus reading the text.
When I graduated, I could get a job making $65k/yr.
$65000/(52 weeks * 40 hrs/wk) = $31.25/hr.
It's really great you're trying to learn all this at your age. One of the best lessons you can learn young is everyone in life has different circumstances. You're very fortunate if your state allows you to get a highly discounted tuition for being a top student. Most states don't. You also mention filling out the FAFSA. Well, that requires your parents to give their tax info. Some parents don't believe they should be responsible for their kid going to college. My wife top of her class, accepted to every school she applied to (including MIT), but couldn't get scholarships because her parents refused to fill out the FAFSA. They also wouldn't help her pay for college. Thankfully, one school was willing to help, but it was in a very high cost of living area. She tried to balance a job with paying for school, but it was too much and she had to drop out. She returned to college a few years later after she didn't need her parent's to submit the FAFSA, but it was hard for her to get over for many years. When I as your age, I never even would have though a situation like that was possible, let alone uncommon."

[This paper explains a bit about the difference, and how the conversion works.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233231163_A_Comparison_of_Energy_Densities_of_Prevalent_Energy_Sources_in_Units_of_Joules_Per_Cubic_Meter) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, [let\'s talk a little bit about load profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_profile). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnywhere in the world is going to have peaks and dips in the electrical demand, based on human activity, time of day, time of year, temperature, and dozens of other factors. Not all power plants are made equally, and not all are best at meeting all load demands at all times. There are a few basic types of electrical loads that are on the grid at any given time, of which I\'ll touch on a couple briefly:\n\n* [Base load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load) is the minimum load that\'s always present on the grid - this is measured over a time span by a utility or regulatory body and is very reliable in terms of what the actual demand is over long periods of time. This can be represented by your home refrigerator and freezer that\'s always running, regardless of how many frozen meals you have squeezed in your freezer door. **Large power plants**, i.e. nuclear, coal, and large hydropower sites are best suited to meet this load demand. This is because these large plants are most economical when they\'re running constantly at a high load factor (meeting large loads), and they are slow to react to rapid changes or fluctuations in power because of several factors that are outside this scope (but which I\'d be happy to talk about later). \n* [Peak demand load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand) is the load on the grid that occurs at a single point during a day- in winter it could be first thing in the morning as heaters are turned on, or in summer it could be in mid to late afternoon as air conditioning units are working their hardest based on outside temperature. This load has to be anticipated, and there are forecasting models that can help determine what the window is for when the peak will occur. Because it will be an instantaneous process, there need to be power sources online that can meet the peak when it hits. Smaller power plants, or what we call **peaker plants**, are often used to meet this demand. Gas turbines powered by natural gas or oil are often currently used to meet this demand, but they\'re horribly expensive per unit energy, have a lower capacity factor, and still have to be spun up and brought online beforehand (though this can be done in usually half an hour to an hour, as opposed to the days or multiple hours it will take to start up a nuclear or coal power plant). This is an application we\'re seeing more and more interest with regards to solar or wind, especially when paired with an energy storage system (i.e. batteries). \n\nNow, speaking of costs of power plants. Nuclear is horrifically expensive, for a number of reasons. Choosing a site for a plant has to be done very, very carefully, with regards to rights of way, access to a cooling medium (lake, river, coastal zone), seismic considerations, and distance from population centers, to name a few. In addition, very little of the land surrounding a site can be repurposed for other uses over the life of the plant. By contrast, solar can be installed in a variety of places, and the land can be devoted to other uses at the same time. Wind is much the same way- yes, individual wind turbines need a lot of space, but the land between them can be used for other purposes, currently such as farming or grazing. Construction costs for nuclear are also much, much higher, due to the very specialized nature of the work and materials required, the reporting criteria during the construction process, and the massive number of people needed to build a plant. In addition, operating costs are also higher due to the number of highly trained (and thus highly paid) operators needed to operate, administrate, and maintain a plant, and to periodically conduct refueling operations. **Finally, there\'s the question of fuel disposal**. This isn\'t nearly as big of a crisis as most everybody thinks it is, and[we\'ve had the solution for what to do with spent fuel for quite a few years now](https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/27032/GE-nuclear-reactor-waste). Unfortunately, the politics of the uninformed has driven a lot of the policy around reprocessing spent fuel and nuclear power in general, and it\'s been to the detriment of literally everybody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, we need both nuclear and renewables, but for very different purposes and reasons. We need new nuclear plants to replace existing coal and oil-fired plants for base loading, especially as the population continues to grow. We need renewable sources to better respond to intermediate and peak loads, and to provide a greater diversity of load to help power all of our ""gadgets,"" especially as plug-in electric cars continue to gain more and more popularity. And just as urgently, we need more flexible power grids that can be adaptable and expandable to both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this answers your question.'}","How does nuclear power compare to that of others (solar, wind, coal, etc.)?

* [Base load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load) is the minimum load that's always present on the grid - this is measured over a time span by a utility or regulatory body and is very reliable in terms of what the actual demand is over long periods of time. This can be represented by your home refrigerator and freezer that's always running, regardless of how many frozen meals you have squeezed in your freezer door. **Large power plants**, i.e. nuclear, coal, and large hydropower sites are best suited to meet this load demand. This is because these large plants are most economical when they're running constantly at a high load factor (meeting large loads), and they are slow to react to rapid changes or fluctuations in power because of several factors that are outside this scope (but which I'd be happy to talk about later). 
* [Peak demand load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand) is the load on the grid that occurs at a single point during a day- in winter it could be first thing in the morning as heaters are turned on, or in summer it could be in mid to late afternoon as air conditioning units are working their hardest based on outside temperature. This load has to be anticipated, and there are forecasting models that can help determine what the window is for when the peak will occur. Because it will be an instantaneous process, there need to be power sources online that can meet the peak when it hits. Smaller power plants, or what we call **peaker plants**, are often used to meet this demand. Gas turbines powered by natural gas or oil are often currently used to meet this demand, but they're horribly expensive per unit energy, have a lower capacity factor, and still have to be spun up and brought online beforehand (though this can be done in usually half an hour to an hour, as opposed to the days or multiple hours it will take to start up a nuclear or coal power plant). This is an application we're seeing more and more interest with regards to solar or wind, especially when paired with an energy storage system (i.e. batteries). 
Now, speaking of costs of power plants. Nuclear is horrifically expensive, for a number of reasons. Choosing a site for a plant has to be done very, very carefully, with regards to rights of way, access to a cooling medium (lake, river, coastal zone), seismic considerations, and distance from population centers, to name a few. In addition, very little of the land surrounding a site can be repurposed for other uses over the life of the plant. By contrast, solar can be installed in a variety of places, and the land can be devoted to other uses at the same time. Wind is much the same way- yes, individual wind turbines need a lot of space, but the land between them can be used for other purposes, currently such as farming or grazing. Construction costs for nuclear are also much, much higher, due to the very specialized nature of the work and materials required, the reporting criteria during the construction process, and the massive number of people needed to build a plant. In addition, operating costs are also higher due to the number of highly trained (and thus highly paid) operators needed to operate, administrate, and maintain a plant, and to periodically conduct refueling operations. **Finally, there's the question of fuel disposal**. This isn't nearly as big of a crisis as most everybody thinks it is, and[we've had the solution for what to do with spent fuel for quite a few years now](https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/27032/GE-nuclear-reactor-waste). Unfortunately, the politics of the uninformed has driven a lot of the policy around reprocessing spent fuel and nuclear power in general, and it's been to the detriment of literally everybody.
&amp;#x200B;
In conclusion, we need both nuclear and renewables, but for very different purposes and reasons. We need new nuclear plants to replace existing coal and oil-fired plants for base loading, especially as the population continues to grow. We need renewable sources to better respond to intermediate and peak loads, and to provide a greater diversity of load to help power all of our ""gadgets,"" especially as plug-in electric cars continue to gain more and more popularity. And just as urgently, we need more flexible power grids that can be adaptable and expandable to both.
&amp;#x200B;
I hope this answers your question."

I mean, you aren't complaining that your NES cartridges don't work in your Switch (which also uses cartridges), right? It's a much more obvious difference in media, but it's the same idea. And the same thing would go for many types of vintage things. Collect old pens or vintage instruments or old toys/board games or, again, cars work well. Used and original parts of decades old cars will eventually run out and/or get increasingly expensive. It's just the nature of old things and the march of technological progress."

However, once you restart your computer, most of that memory is wiped clean and you start fresh, so your computer is often faster.  Basically, on a restart, your computer ""empties the trash can,"" so you can start filling it up again, without constantly having to try to compact the trash to fit more in the can."

most people have hands and the dexterity to do this.

You can upload a video.
&gt;take blood
Not usually needed. If it seems relevant you can just mail it to a service in a test tube."

Doesn't that contradict the very definition of ""infinite""?","&gt;When I spoke of ranges, 0 to 1 and 0 to 2, I never said anything about running out, I talked about what is in the set vs. what is not in the set. There is countability, which is infinite, and value, which is not necessarily infinite.
Value, in what sense?
&gt;And what is ""real""? Because there are different infinites that are real.
No infinites are real because infinite is a logically impossible concept, like Omnipotence
&gt;Take for example a ruler and a yard stick - cut them up an infinite number of times, there will both be an infinite number of pieces, but there was way more yard stick than there was a standard 12"" ruler, so this just goes to show yet again two infinities that are different sizes.
But there *wasn't* more yard stick, if you start pairing up the pieces you will never get to a point where you have a piece in your hand you can't pair with any other. 
And again, talking about infinity's size is like talking about a desert's desertness
&gt;Take another example, a variation of Gabriels Horn. We'll use cake: if you take a cake, which has a finite volume, sitting there on your table, and you cut it in half - the total volume of cake hasn't changed, but you exposed 2 new faces on both halves, where you cut. Now cut those pieces in half, and again, and again... The volume of cake never ever changes, you started with one cake, but if you cut the pieces in half an infinite number of times, you will end up with a cake of finite volume and infinite surface area. You would need an infinite amount of frosting to cover the whole thing. This is called a super solid.
I understand the experiment but I don't see the connection between it and the comparability of Infinity.
Also, thought I should mention: You're cutting a cake into infinite pieces and marvelling at the fact that you obtain something impossible. The thing is, cutting a cake into infinite pieces is also impossible. Of course by ""doing"" something impossible you would obtain an impossible ""result"", it can't be another way.
&gt;How about a Supertask? This is a countably infinite number of operations in a finite period of time. Take for example a system where we have to observe some rules. A lamp. If the lamp is off, it must be turned on. If a lamp is on, it must be turned off. This is a system that will execute forever without terminating. With a Supertask, we are going to observe all the infinite tasks in a time box, say 2 minutes. When time starts, you change the state of the lamp, if it's on, turn it off, if it's off, turn it on. Then wait a minute, and then change state again. Then wait 30 seconds, and change state, then wait 15 seconds, change state, 7.5 seconds, change state... As you reach the half way point of the remaining time, you perform the next operation, faster and faster... Time inevitably hits 2 minutes, and all the infinite tasks have been observed!
&gt;I'm not just crazy, this happens in real life ALL THE TIME. It's happening around you right now. Time, is a Supertask, walking from a start to a destination is a Supertask. There are infinities wrapped up all around us, and we have to count or observe the whole set all the time.

Plus, it looks like there's a sort of truncated pyramid stuck to each face of the small cube, and the bases of these 6 shapes form the big cube.  Well, those truncated pyramids in 3D are actually cubes in 4D.  Which just feels weird.  The 'inside' cube looks smaller because it's further away in the 4th dimension.
How does this relate to 2D/3D?  Well, take a wireframe cube and take a picture of it from close up.  What you'll see is a square inside a square, with diagonals connecting the corners.  It looks like the lines are all different lengths, but each is the exact same in 3D.  It's just that some are further away than others.  And, it also looks like each edge of the small square has a trapezium attached, and these trapeziums (trapezia?) form the bigger square.  But we know that each of those trapeziums is actually a *square* face of the 3D cube."

The lenses in a VR set also refocus light, but are designed to simulate distance rather than correct for eye shape. Wearing your glasses or contacts with the vr headset will add the corrections needed for your eyes."

Maybe I got the story wrong, so I\'ll just take your word for it for the sake of discussion.\n\nIt sounds like we\'re saying the same thing--Europeans and Native Americans had different immune systems due to what diseases they had been exposed to. But I\'m puzzled why you\'d think that those differences were a racial difference.  ""Race"" implies a genetic, heritable difference, one that is innate to a person and to all of the people of the same race. But the immunity to disease is an acquired, environmental difference. It doesn\'t derive from having Native American ancestry. If a newborn Native American were teleported to Europe in 1600 and raised there, that individual would likely have the same disease immunity that a person of Germany ancestry. And if a newborn Irish kid had been teleported to 1600 American continent, they\'d almost certainly die along with 90-95% of the Native American  inhabitants of the eastern US in the plague that occurred in that time and place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don\'t understand the need to go about arguing that we\'re all the same exact thing. A fair white person will sunburn more easily than a dark black person. Does this example not suffice that we\'re biologically different? Why do I have to start listing out examples until we find one that works. You must firmly believe that we are physiologically identical to each other, otherwise you wouldn\'t make me go through such trouble for debate.\n\nI think you\'re misrepresenting the position of people who are saying that race is a cultural, not biological, construct. No one is arguing that a white person and a black person react the same to the sun. What they\'re saying is that the criteria that are ascribed to divide people into different groups are false; that the distinct categorizations of peoples into races does not reflect true biological differences. There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there\'s zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn\'t in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable. Change can be confusing and stressful so saying that this is just the way things are, and that the way I personally see the world is unambiguously, completely accurately, THE way the world IS, is comforting. \n\nBut there are a lot more genetic differences within a given race than between different races. Also, virtually all humans who are descended from people from outside sub-Saharan Africa are quite similar, as compared to the differences between any 2 people of different villages in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, modern humans, it seems, evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then a small subset of those people left Africa and populated the rest of the planet. All the differences you see among Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, etc., all come from this small subset of people that left Africa.  Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it\'s simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that\'s false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you\'d have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don\'t like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let\'s think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that\'s a bit weird because you\'re ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it\'s like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it\'s not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they\'re the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it\'s just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let\'s accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don\'t fall into distinct groups as if they\'re separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it\'s very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There\'s a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There\'s no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you\'re black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there\'s no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let\'s choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don\'t. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It\'s just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn\'t. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don\'t equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren\'t inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes.'}",| Why does the term 'race' only apply to humankind?,"&gt;The way I heard the disease story was that the immune systems of those European settlers was adapted to resisting the disease due to years of living in their agrarian society.

I'm in a gridlock at this point. I want the surgery, because I like to exercise and be fit, but I also know that addiction is literal Hell. In my experience, Hell isn't real in the afterlife, but Hell is real in this life. 
Idk. I know I've derailed this conversation, but I just want to share my fears. What if I fall back into Hell? I cant handle that. 
Anyway, thanks for responding fellow redditor and giving me some insight. I hope to overcome this, and I'm confident I will, but I'm also terrified. So I guess we'll see how this plays out."

Now, imagine you have a little valve you can open to release a stream of that pressurized gas and shoot it at a pinwheel to make it spin. The pressure of the gas in the pump drops as it passes through the valve (and the gas speeds up), then that fast stream of gas smacks into the pinwheel and makes it spin (while the gas slows down in the process). \n\nYou then have to collect that gas and spend some energy to bring it back to the initial conditions so you can repeat the cycle. The useful work you get out is the difference between the work the gas does on the turbine and the work you have to put back in to reset the system.\n\nSame thing is happening in a closed water cycle with turbines and condensers. \n\nIn this analogy, you could imagine two differently designed pumps, where one stroke on each creates a different pressure at the outlet. Can think of a big ass pump a foot in diameter vs a tiny ass pump an inch diameter. One stroke on each will produce a different output.\n This is somewhat analogous to the difference between water or acetone.

It would not turn the turbine at all, but you would still have to cool it down again to reset the cycle ending up with a negative efficiency. \n\nSo again, it is the change in pressure that drives the whole process. Water just happens to be efficient for producing large changes in pressure between the liquid and vapor phases for a given input of energy.

Now, imagine you have a little valve you can open to release a stream of that pressurized gas and shoot it at a pinwheel to make it spin. The pressure of the gas in the pump drops as it passes through the valve (and the gas speeds up), then that fast stream of gas smacks into the pinwheel and makes it spin (while the gas slows down in the process). 
You then have to collect that gas and spend some energy to bring it back to the initial conditions so you can repeat the cycle. The useful work you get out is the difference between the work the gas does on the turbine and the work you have to put back in to reset the system.
Same thing is happening in a closed water cycle with turbines and condensers. 
In this analogy, you could imagine two differently designed pumps, where one stroke on each creates a different pressure at the outlet. Can think of a big ass pump a foot in diameter vs a tiny ass pump an inch diameter. One stroke on each will produce a different output.
 This is somewhat analogous to the difference between water or acetone. For any given material, a given input of energy will boil a given mass of the material and result in a given change in the pressure of the gas.
Taking it to the extreme end of poor performance, an imaginary material that boiled into a gas of the same volume as the liquid would not produce any change in pressure. It would not turn the turbine at all, but you would still have to cool it down again to reset the cycle ending up with a negative efficiency. 
So again, it is the change in pressure that drives the whole process. Water just happens to be efficient for producing large changes in pressure between the liquid and vapor phases for a given input of energy.   In a perfect world, we would have some material that suddenly expands to a gas of 10 million times the liquid volume with very little heat input and is non-toxic and cheap and all of this happens near room temperature. In the real world, plain old water is just the best way to go...."

If it’s boring in school it’s mostly because of boring teachers or boring curricula, or both. Chemistry is an amazing science because it’s so essential to everything around us. 
If it takes 5 years to discover element 119, and even if it takes 5 years past that for each other element you’re looking at nearly 50000 years. And that’s a theoretical number pulled out of nowhere with no basis in reality. There’s other problems to overcome, like heavier elements needing electrons to travel at faster than the speed of light and somehow overcoming the repulsion of protons in the nucleus."

The main character will usually get more development because they are a main character. I thought that was understood?\n\nIm just expanding the definition to include exceptions. Sure extra characters usually dont have much character development but ive seen a few extras have tons of character development. Just because you are a side character doesnt mean you dont get development. Thats a double standard (i think i used that term correctly). Its the same for a main character. Just because you are a main character doesnt mean you will always get development.\n\nRather than looking at the characters importance in the story first, i think acknowledging they are a character first, and a main character second is better. After youve acknowledged that you are looking at a character that might or might not be a main character, you should look at the characters complexity. And then after that, you should look at the characters importance and how that ties to the characters complexity and relationship to the plot.\n\nAlso on the topic of stereotypes, yes they usually are boring, repetitive and lacking in character development, i often see characters that follow a stereotype to the t and still be amazing characters.

The main character will usually get more development because they are a main character. I thought that was understood?
Im just expanding the definition to include exceptions. Sure extra characters usually dont have much character development but ive seen a few extras have tons of character development. Just because you are a side character doesnt mean you dont get development. Thats a double standard (i think i used that term correctly). Its the same for a main character. Just because you are a main character doesnt mean you will always get development.
Rather than looking at the characters importance in the story first, i think acknowledging they are a character first, and a main character second is better. After youve acknowledged that you are looking at a character that might or might not be a main character, you should look at the characters complexity. And then after that, you should look at the characters importance and how that ties to the characters complexity and relationship to the plot.
Also on the topic of stereotypes, yes they usually are boring, repetitive and lacking in character development, i often see characters that follow a stereotype to the t and still be amazing characters. Sometimes its because they fill a stereotype they are great characters. Sometimes the stereotype is just a bonus to an already great character.
