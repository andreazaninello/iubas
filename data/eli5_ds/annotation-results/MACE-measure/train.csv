**Setup**

*Notation*

Just to go over notation - all upper case things I write will represent a computer or subroutine of a computer. The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run. If I say something like x = M(y), that means I took the value y, put it into M's memory, allowed it to run, and then once it's done take the resulting stuff in memory and put it into x.

*Quines*

To simplify the structure, I'm going to use the existence of a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\)) - a computer that prints its own source code. The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.

So, if I did something like this:

    M() {
      x = GETMYCODE()
      PRINT(x)
    }

It would print out
    x = GETMYCODE()
    PRINT(x)

*'Weak' Halting Problem*

I'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have. The more general form is ""Is there a computer which, when given some source code and an input value, can determine whether that code will halt when given that input?"". I'm going to ask a narrower question ""Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?""

It turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.

**The Proof**

We want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.

So, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either ""true"" or ""false"".

So, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this

    M() {
      x = GETMYOWNCODE()
      answer = H(x)
      if answer is ""true"", loop
      otherwise, halt
    }

And let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is ""true"", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).

Now, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider.

However: A) humans on average live a lot longer than 15 years and B) there really isn’t an ethical way to test human susceptibility given the known neurodegenerative risks. 

Source: I am a biologist who has looked this up many many times after doing fieldwork in the Midwest. Permethrin is the best I’ve come up with and it has its own risks. 

Also a close friend works in the call center for one of the big companies that develops and distributes several of these compounds, and she answers questions about these very medications on a daily basis."

A dimension is a direction in space that can be traversed which is orthagonal to any other dimensions. A single dimension woul indeed be a line but that woul not be time (usually). When people are talking about dimenstions, they usually mean spacial dimensions. Time is a 4th dimension but it is not considered to be spacial. 

&gt;I think people mistake dimensions as these separate pockets of existence but I think the fourth dimension has to be size, infinite micro and the infinite macro. 

Dimensions actually can be ""pockets of space"" if used correctly but **a** 4th dimension is certainly not size. Size is fully described in any number of dimenstions. in 1D it is the length of a line. in 2D it is the area of a shape (or its perimeter or extents). In 3D it is volume (or surface area, etc.). A fourth dimension is not size itself. If you are thinking of things getting bigger or smaller like a shrink ray then thats just science fiction. If you are thinking more like a baloon, then that is just 1, 2, or 3 dimensions just acting normally. 

In short, there is nothing strange, fancy, or unique about a 4th spacial dimension as it works exactly like the other three we are used to. This has nothing to do with science or physics, it is entirely base in math. It's good to ask questions but thinking it is wrong is like disagreeing when someone says 2+2 = 4."

It's also opening the door for things like [community solar projects](https://www.energysage.com/solar/community-solar/community-solar-power-explained/), which are gaining more and more popularity with smaller municipalities and towns as citizens look to how they can help reduce their own carbon footprints.

You can measure the distance between the door and window in meters, but it's not useful at all for the area of the room. For an area, you need to square the meter, which represents a 2d surface. Then when you want to measure how much water is in a container, you need to go up to cubic meters, which represent a volume. Square rooting goes the other way. Distance in our world is also measured by adding together the squares of displacement in each direction and then square rooting it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big place you'll see it is probability. The probability of flipping a coin and 5 times and getting all heads is equal to the probability of it happening once, to the power of how many times you do it. Thus (0.5\^5)."

GoldEdit

Chrysopoeia, the artificial production of gold, is the symbolic goal of alchemy. Such transmutation is possible in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, although the production cost is currently many times the market price of gold. Since there is only one stable gold isotope, 197Au, nuclear reactions must create this isotope in order to produce usable gold.

Gold synthesis in an acceleratorEdit

Gold synthesis in a particle accelerator is possible in many ways. The Spallation Neutron Source has a liquid mercury target which will be transmuted into gold, platinum, and iridium, which are lower in atomic number than mercury.[citation needed]

Gold synthesis in a nuclear reactorEdit

Gold was synthesized from mercury by neutron bombardment in 1941, but the isotopes of gold produced were all radioactive.[12] In 1924, a Japanese physicist, Hantaro Nagaoka, accomplished the same feat.[13]

Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by the irradiation of either platinum or mercury."

The humanity of a character can sometimes determine the complexity. All characters will have some level of humanity but the dimensions of a character will depend on the level of humanity. Humanity isnt always a good decider of a character complexity it was just the first thing that came to mind (mostly because ive been reading slice of life manga). The complexity (dimensions) of a character can be determined by many factors. Some could be their actions, reactions, way of life, thinking, etc. Mostly things that define a character and make them special and different from other characters. Ofcourse non complex characters can have charactistics that make them different from others but sometimes those characters feel like they have those characteristics just to be different rather than to be a good character. Another factor is the characters back story or their history. The history of a characters should support why they are who they are. Examples could vary from a characters parents were killed by a criminal so the character wants to hunt down criminals to a character thats was kind to another character when they were a child so the character tries to be kind to everyone because of that.  If the characters parents were killed by criminals but they tried to be nice to criminals that wouldnt make too much sense.

The humanity of a character can sometimes determine the complexity. All characters will have some level of humanity but the dimensions of a character will depend on the level of humanity. Humanity isnt always a good decider of a character complexity it was just the first thing that came to mind (mostly because ive been reading slice of life manga). The complexity (dimensions) of a character can be determined by many factors. Some could be their actions, reactions, way of life, thinking, etc. Mostly things that define a character and make them special and different from other characters. Ofcourse non complex characters can have charactistics that make them different from others but sometimes those characters feel like they have those characteristics just to be different rather than to be a good character. Another factor is the characters back story or their history. The history of a characters should support why they are who they are. Examples could vary from a characters parents were killed by a criminal so the character wants to hunt down criminals to a character thats was kind to another character when they were a child so the character tries to be kind to everyone because of that.  If the characters parents were killed by criminals but they tried to be nice to criminals that wouldnt make too much sense.

So for me personally as a vaccinated, healthy adult it makes no difference if you are vaccinated or not.
For my little daughter or my cancer stricken relative it is a life or death situation (unfortunately quite literally).

Therefore if you are healthy and able to get a shot, go get a shot. It will safe someone's life.

(Kind of the same principle as you clear a lane for an ambulance. Yes it is inconvenient for you for 30 seconds but you help safe a live and you would expect others to do it for you)."

If used properly, I still don't recommend using it every single day or more than is suggested on the lable because after a few weeks it messes with the bacteria in your gut and you gotta balance it out with probiotics. So daily use is fine a few weeks at a time.

Top Layer

Content: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.

Program: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language.

For instance, you might write an instruction like ""If (comment_length &gt; 40000) : return error.""

Machine Code: This is the code your CPU actually runs. You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute. This consists of much simpler instructions like

    Set the ALU to perform two's-complement addition
    
    Set the ALU's carry input to zero
    
    Store the result value in register 8

this machine code is directly accessing the data stored in 2 memory registers and adding them, storing the result in a 3rd register.

The shadow is exactly behind the Earth.

I teach five year olds. (XD) So if we assume the singularity has occurred already, then we must have found out more about consciousness than we already know. It’s difficult to say whether the biological brain is more than the sum of input/output of information, motor control, and interpretation/ production of chemicals meant to drive the body towards a particular evolutionarily beneficial behavior. If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we’d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I’m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of... Could we call it a species? Could we call it intelligent? Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call “all too human” which have plagued us for as long as we have been? With no space for subconsciousness or biases, with no ego, and with the ability to process information exponentially faster than the creatures which came before, with unlimited access to information, and the capability to increase storage space AS DESIRED, would there even be anything left to strive for? Oh, Timmy, I may have gotten a little bit existential. It wasn’t my intention.\n\nVery tough to make a call there. \n1. The new being is most likely it’s own category now. What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature’s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new “species” would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. \n\n2. If we kind of upgrade the existing frame with a new engine, a more modern dashboard, etc. then it’s 100% the same species, in the same evolutionary chain.\n\n3. The reason I say new category in #1 is— what do people consider their deity/deities right now?

Why are all animals seemingly more robust than humans, even if smaller?","(Did not intel to become an author here, TL;DR is at bottom) Timmy, I’ll answer your question, but with a caveat. I teach five year olds. (XD) So if we assume the singularity has occurred already, then we must have found out more about consciousness than we already know. It’s difficult to say whether the biological brain is more than the sum of input/output of information, motor control, and interpretation/ production of chemicals meant to drive the body towards a particular evolutionarily beneficial behavior. If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we’d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I’m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of... Could we call it a species? Could we call it intelligent? Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call “all too human” which have plagued us for as long as we have been? With no space for subconsciousness or biases, with no ego, and with the ability to process information exponentially faster than the creatures which came before, with unlimited access to information, and the capability to increase storage space AS DESIRED, would there even be anything left to strive for? Oh, Timmy, I may have gotten a little bit existential. It wasn’t my intention.

Very tough to make a call there. 
1. The new being is most likely it’s own category now. What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature’s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new “species” would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. 

2. If we kind of upgrade the existing frame with a new engine, a more modern dashboard, etc. then it’s 100% the same species, in the same evolutionary chain.

3. The reason I say new category in #1 is— what do people consider their deity/deities right now? Deity is not the best word here, but regardless of personal beliefs/truths about the beginnings of life, we would 100% be creators. Can you consider a creator to be of the same species? 

Eh bottom line for me, Timmy. New ingredients, new recipe, different baker, different cake.

There never was a baker, mid and match of ingredients, different icing, what the hell even is a cake, then, Timmy? Coherent enough or no?"

Smaller power plants, or what we call **peaker plants**, are often used to meet this demand. Gas turbines powered by natural gas or oil are often currently used to meet this demand, but they\'re horribly expensive per unit energy, have a lower capacity factor, and still have to be spun up and brought online beforehand (though this can be done in usually half an hour to an hour, as opposed to the days or multiple hours it will take to start up a nuclear or coal power plant).

There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there\'s zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn\'t in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable.

Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it\'s simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that\'s false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you\'d have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don\'t like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let\'s think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that\'s a bit weird because you\'re ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it\'s like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it\'s not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they\'re the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it\'s just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let\'s accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don\'t fall into distinct groups as if they\'re separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it\'s very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There\'s a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There\'s no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you\'re black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there\'s no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let\'s choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don\'t. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It\'s just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn\'t. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don\'t equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren\'t inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes.'}",| Why does the term 'race' only apply to humankind?,"&gt;The way I heard the disease story was that the immune systems of those European settlers was adapted to resisting the disease due to years of living in their agrarian society.

In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It's just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn't. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don't equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren't inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes."
