If you were drawing out the dimensions on computer program like paint.exe you would start with the first dimension being a straight line which I think is time, backwards and forwards being the only modes of movement in a way

Then you would move on to the second dimension which is movement up down forwards backwards and all combinations of those movements, all of 2d space. You could represent this with a square.

So if you were to experience this firsthand and you could somehow keep your form while increasing or decreasing your size almost infinitely fast, reality to you would appear as if you were going through a tunnel as things would constantly change around you but perception wise you would stay the same size.

So I think the fourth dimension Tesseract is an incomplete model as it only shows two different sizes the inner cube and the outer cube, but I think it should be three as there’s always something bigger and smaller and everything has a middle ground of perspective so it would be a cube within a cube within a cube."
