Again as others have done, P is the abstract program/computer, while &lt;P&gt; is its textual description.

Let's say H is a program that tells you true or false. Not an oracle, just a program.

We write P as usual.

    P(x):

But I\'m puzzled why you\'d think that those differences were a racial difference.  ""Race"" implies a genetic, heritable difference, one that is innate to a person and to all of the people of the same race. But the immunity to disease is an acquired, environmental difference. It doesn\'t derive from having Native American ancestry. If a newborn Native American were teleported to Europe in 1600 and raised there, that individual would likely have the same disease immunity that a person of Germany ancestry. And if a newborn Irish kid had been teleported to 1600 American continent, they\'d almost certainly die along with 90-95% of the Native American  inhabitants of the eastern US in the plague that occurred in that time and place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don\'t understand the need to go about arguing that we\'re all the same exact thing.

You must firmly believe that we are physiologically identical to each other, otherwise you wouldn\'t make me go through such trouble for debate.\n\nI think you\'re misrepresenting the position of people who are saying that race is a cultural, not biological, construct. No one is arguing that a white person and a black person react the same to the sun. What they\'re saying is that the criteria that are ascribed to divide people into different groups are false; that the distinct categorizations of peoples into races does not reflect true biological differences. There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there\'s zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn\'t in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable. Change can be confusing and stressful so saying that this is just the way things are, and that the way I personally see the world is unambiguously, completely accurately, THE way the world IS, is comforting. \n\nBut there are a lot more genetic differences within a given race than between different races. Also, virtually all humans who are descended from people from outside sub-Saharan Africa are quite similar, as compared to the differences between any 2 people of different villages in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, modern humans, it seems, evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then a small subset of those people left Africa and populated the rest of the planet. All the differences you see among Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, etc., all come from this small subset of people that left Africa.  Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it\'s simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that\'s false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you\'d have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don\'t like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let\'s think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that\'s a bit weird because you\'re ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it\'s like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it\'s not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they\'re the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it\'s just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let\'s accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don\'t fall into distinct groups as if they\'re separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it\'s very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There\'s a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There\'s no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you\'re black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there\'s no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let\'s choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don\'t. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It\'s just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn\'t. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don\'t equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren\'t inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes.'}",| Why does the term 'race' only apply to humankind?,"&gt;The way I heard the disease story was that the immune systems of those European settlers was adapted to resisting the disease due to years of living in their agrarian society.

There's multiple factors. 

One is the lack of contact with other civilizations. 

Many civilizations in the old world traded information on how to do things, which affected their history, economy and technology. For example, Gunpowder was a Chinese invention, and eventually was used with the invention of the Gun to create a weapon that was far superior than any in history. Sub-saharan Africa didn't have significant contact with the rest of the old world until European colonization. 

Most of modern Africa today is poor and uneducated because of corruption, wars, poor economic planning and situations which leaves many in bad health."
