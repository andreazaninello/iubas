So in that case we'd run the Trickster program with the Trickster program as input. But then it asks the oracle if the Trickster program, using the source code of the Trickster program as input, would eventually halt. But that's what we're running in the first place! Now the oracle, by it's very definition, has to always be correct, otherwise it wouldn't be an oracle. So if the oracle says that it halts, then the Trickster program has to halt, and vice versa.\n\nExcept the Trickster program does the opposite of what the oracle says it does.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you.

So in that case we'd run the Trickster program with the Trickster program as input. But then it asks the oracle if the Trickster program, using the source code of the Trickster program as input, would eventually halt. But that's what we're running in the first place! Now the oracle, by it's very definition, has to always be correct, otherwise it wouldn't be an oracle.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\".

In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle.

Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"\n\nYeah, the subroutine thing is what I've been trying to explain as well. First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you. If it tells you that x stops, then P(x) won't stop, and if it tells you that x doesn't stop, then P(x) stops.\n\nThis thing, one instruction list telling you to do another instruction list, is what a sub-routine is.\n\nSo far so good?"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "I understand--I think--that H(a,b) could be a list of instructions.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it.

The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"\n\nYeah, the subroutine thing is what I've been trying to explain as well.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.  Are \"source code\" and \"program\" the same thing?\n\n--Are \"Trickster\" and \"M\" the same thing?  \n\nFinally, let me copy-and-paste the portion of the HuffPo explanation that is the most confusing to me:\n\n\"Now let\u2019s build a slightly more elaborate program P. This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it. Similarly, the Oracle and H are the same thing.\n\n---\n\nI won't comment on the HuffPo explanation because I think that's going back to the explanation I tried to use in the beginning."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Also, I found this explanation at Stack Exchange, which I am roughly 60% close to understanding (my comments are in brackets):\n\n\"Ignore the picture for a moment; we'll get to it shortly. The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).  In addition to taking only one input, it also (as part of its source code, I guess) runs a so-called \"sub-routine\"--where it invokes Oracle and then, based on what Oracle does, does the opposite.  I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

First, can we say that the H(a,b) is a list of instructions, that in the end tells you whether program a will halt when run with input b?\n\nIf so, P(x) tells you to perform the H(x,x) list of instructions and then look at that it tells you.

It just takes that location and tells the Oracle \"You can find both your inputs at this location\". They don't actually reside inside M, M too only knows the location.\n\nAbout the nature of source code. Source code is essentially just a list of instructions. In that regard you can think of it alike to a cooking recipe. So say a recipe requires you to make mayonnaise. But it doesn't tell you how you can make mayonnaise, you have to look at a separate mayonnaise recipe for that. If you only have the main recipe but now the mayonnaise recipe, it's incomplete. So despite the mayonnaise recipe being its own separate thing, it's also part of the main recipe.\n\nCode can be combined similarly. The Oracle doesn't necessarily have to reside inside M. But M knows where the Oracle is and can visit it to ask. When I said that the Oracle is part of M, I meant that M would be incomplete without the Oracle. In order for the source code of M to be complete, you also need the source code of the Oracle.\n\nNow when you give H the source code of M, that must include the Oracle's source code, or H couldn't make its decision."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Point by point response might be easiest:\n\n- No, I don't have any idea of how Oracle (by the way, is \"Oracle\" the same as \"H\"?) finds its inputs--I have simply accepted as a given that it somehow gets fed two pieces of input, one being a program and the other being input to that program.  \n\n--I don't understand the \"find it at this location\" concept.  \n\n--I can somewhat conceptualize source code as instructions.

This program receives input J, and what it does is this: it duplicates J into two copies, and then runs magical program M with the two copies of J as inputs (Remember that M takes two pieces of input, so we give it (J, J)). Program M says either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. If it says Yes, our big program P enters an infinite loop. If M says \u201cNo\u201d, P stops.\n\nP is a pretty simple program, built around the program M. You can even write in in actual code, at one point invoking a call to M.\n\nNow let\u2019s run P with its own code as input, meaning that input J that P expects, we just let it be the code of P itself. Remember, as always: code is just a bunch of text.\n\nWhat P does now is ask M: \u201cwhat happens when P runs with input P?\u201d, which, behold, is exactly what we are doing. And whatever M says will happen, P makes sure to do the exact opposite. So M could not have correctly predicted what happens in this peculiar situation. But M was supposed to always answer correctly.\"\n\nI don't understand any of the above-quoted explanation--the duplication stuff, where \"J\" comes from, how \"P\" is \"run\" with \"P\" as its input, etc.  That's what got me down originally--this explanation is supposed to be comprehensible to a 13-year-old and I find it absolutely convoluted, and, frankly, baffling."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, I think I can work with that.\n\nSo, barring some simplifications, everything in a computer somehow resides in its memory. The memory is just some storage for data. You can think of it like a locker box, every data is in one of the boxes, and each box has a number (aka an address).\n\nPrograms themselves are also data that's kept in a box, so they have an address as well.\n\nSo when a program has a location, it can check the corresponding box to find what's inside.\n\n(In case you worry about the analogy, it's perfectly valid for address purposes.)\n\n---\n\nSo a program has some blank spots where the locations of the input can be put when running it. This works because the size of a location is known, even if the size of the data at that location isn't known. That's how they find they're input.\n\n---\n\nSource code and programs are related, but not quite the same. Specifically, the computer is rather limited in what it understands directly. Source code instructions are designed to be understandable by humans and thus not something the computer can directly understand. However, source code instructions can be translated into program code instructions that do the same thing, but are simple enough that the computer understands them. Importantly, the computer is able to do that translation from source code to program code itself if told how.\n\nSo in a certain way source code and program code are the same thing but in different languages. You can kinda compare them to English and Simple English on Wikipedia, just more technical.\n\nNow \"program code\" and \"program\" are effectively the same thing, while the \"source code\" isn't because the computer doesn't directly understand it. However, the translation between them is the reason why I earlier called the source code a blueprint of the program.\n\n---\n\nYes, Trickster and M are the same thing, I just copied the name you used for it.

The program H(a,b) is supposed to be a halt tester: when we give H an input of a program a (think of a as the listing of a program) and anything at all for b, H(a,b) acts as follows\n\nIf the program represented by a halts when given b as input, H(a,b) will answer \"yes\". On the other hand, if the program described by a runs forever when given input b then H(a,b) will answer \"no\".\nImportantly, program H will always halt and give the correct answer for any pairs (a,b).\n\n[This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"]\n\nThe argument that H is impossible to build relies on the action of a particular \"perverse\" program, P, one which uses H as a subroutine. P takes as its input a listing of any program, x, and does the following:\n\nP(x) =\n  run H(x, x)\n  if H(x, x) answers \"yes\"\n      loop forever\n  else\n      halt\n\n[I'm close to understanding this:  P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

I'm still not sure how the input that Trickster takes figures into this; it appears to be all \"sub-routine and do the opposite.\"]\n\nIt's not hard to see that P(x) will halt if and only if the program x will run forever when given its own description as an input.\n\n[I don't understand what this sentence means.]\n\nSo far so good: P will certainly be a program as long as its subroutine H is a program.\n\n[I don't understand this sentence, either.]\n\nNow return to the picture. What happens if P is given its own description as input? The picture describes just that scenario: Let p be the description of program P, then, substituting into the highlighted part above, we'll have\n\nP(p) will halt if and only if the program P(p) will run forever.\n\n[I don't understand how this follows and it's maddening that the person didn't walk the reader through how it all unfolds--lots of explanations love to gloss over the hard part.]\n\nClearly, this paradoxical behavior is impossible, so we're forced to the conclusion that the subroutine H cannot be a halt tester, since it fails in the one case, where it's given (p,p) as input. There might be other cases where H works as it should, but since H fails in at least one situation, it cannot be a complete halt tester, as required.\"\n\n[I understand part of this--not the (p, p) as input part, but I do understand that because Oracle failed once then it can't be a perfect Oracle.]"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Okay, let's go with this then.\n\n&gt;This much I understand - this is what I've called the \"Oracle.\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I'm close to understanding this: P (what I've called \"Trickster\") takes as its sole argument/input a program--&gt; P(x).

For instance, if I'm designing a website, I don't need to know how the quantum physics of computer chips works, I can just trust the lower layers to take care of that for me. So, lets start at the top and work our way down:\n\nTop Layer\n\nContent: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.\n\nProgram: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language. These are typically \"high level\" languages, meaning they have advanced tools that let you do many things at once.

You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute.

This means that only certain types of things need to interact with each other. For instance, if I'm designing a website, I don't need to know how the quantum physics of computer chips works, I can just trust the lower layers to take care of that for me. So, lets start at the top and work our way down:\n\nTop Layer\n\nContent: A website you're looking at, maybe a reddit comment.\n\nProgram: The instructions to make that website happen are written in some programing language. These are typically \"high level\" languages, meaning they have advanced tools that let you do many things at once. For instance, you might write an instruction like \"If (comment_length &gt; 40000) : return error.\" That's pretty readable to a human, but requires quite a lot of work \"under the hood\" for the computer.\n\nMachine Code: This is the code your CPU actually runs. You make machine code from high-level code with a special program called a *compiler*. The compiler translates the broad, general instructions that humans can read into specific instructions the CPU can execute. This consists of much simpler instructions like \n    \n    Connect register 1 to the A side of the ALU\n    \n    Connect register 7 to the B side of the ALU\n    \n    Set the ALU to perform two's-complement addition\n    \n    Set the ALU's carry input to zero\n    \n    Store the result value in register 8\n\nthis machine code is directly accessing the data stored in 2 memory registers and adding them, storing the result in a 3rd register.\n\nPhysical Layer: This is what we were talking about earlier, circuits that can turn each other on and off, connected in complex ways. Ultimately, computers are switches (transistors) connected to storage devices through complicated networks that correspond to simple calculations, comparing 2 numbers, adding them, reversing, copying, etc. But its all just patterns of ON and OFF, 1 and 0. At the very bottom a computer is just a pile of atoms arranged so that the laws of physics produce results that humans find interesting."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "So how does it go from 10010001 to abcdefg"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "You seem to really want things to inherently \"mean something\".

Its no different than saying A=1, B=2, C=3... and so on. Everything is just strings of numbers that we've agreed to interpret a particular way. The image on your screen is made of groups of 3 numbers, for how much red, green, and blue each pixel should be.

That's what a MegaByte *is* 1 million 8bit numbers. Considering most PCs today have GigaBytes of memory and Terabytes of storage--1000 and 1million times larger respectively--video display isn't that taxing.\n\nThe monitor ultimately just turns lights on and off.

The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run. If I say something like x = M(y), that means I took the value y, put it into M's memory, allowed it to run, and then once it's done take the resulting stuff in memory and put it into x.\n\n*Quines*\n\nTo simplify the structure, I'm going to use the existence of a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\\)) - a computer that prints its own source code. The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.\n\nSo, if I did something like this:\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYCODE()\n      PRINT(x)\n    }\n\nIt would print out\n    x = GETMYCODE()\n    PRINT(x)\n\n*'Weak' Halting Problem*\n\nI'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have.

I'm going to ask a narrower question \"Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?\"\n\nIt turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.\n\n**The Proof**\n\nWe want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.\n\nSo, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nSo, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYOWNCODE()\n      answer = H(x)\n      if answer is \"true\", loop\n      otherwise, halt\n    }\n\nAnd let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is \"true\", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).\n\nNow, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider. Or rephrased, there is no halting decider."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Thank you for this alternate proof--I'm having significant difficulty moving through it, but that may be because of all of the new concepts it introduces and the fact that I know nothing about programming and don't know how to read most pseudo-code.\n\nCan you explain what printing its own source code means?

So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to parse this."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "We have two different programs - H(x) and M. We want to ask - does H predict whether or not M will halt? If M halts, H(&lt;M&gt;) should say \"true\", and if it loops, H(&lt;M&gt;) should say \"false\".\n\nWhen we give H the source code of M as its input, it will say as output either true or false. So, let's do that - we run H(&lt;M&gt;). What happens if it says \"true\"?\n\nM was constructed to have the source code of H as a component in itself, so it can use H while running. When we run M, it gives H its own source code, and uses the output of H to decide whether it should halt or loop forever. In this case, H said \"true\", so M is going to loop forever.\n\nSo, this particular H is not a halting decider for this M. Perhaps it analyzes M for something else, or perhaps it just says something random, but it's definitely not a halting decider.\n\nSo, let's give H another chance - maybe it actually says \"false\" for this M. In that case, when we run M, it will end up immediately halting.\n\nAgain, this H is not a halting decider for this M.\n\nWhat we've shown is that H can't be a halting decider for this M.

Once we construct a physical computer to run stuff on, it can take the source code (a piece of text) and execute it, at which point it is a running program. This action of executing the code is the transition from text into running program. This is what happens when you open something on your computer. It retrieves some data from the disk, and then the CPU goes through that data step by step, performing the real actions that the data was describing.\n\nIn this proof, that's all that happens. I have the two pieces of code H and M. M was specially constructed by me, and uses a copy of the code of H inside of itself. When *I* run H(&lt;M&gt;) and M(), I'm doing the equivalent of opening them on my computer, and in the case of H giving it some text as input. When *M* runs H inside of itself, it is merely a transition into the part of M that I copied from H.

The notation M(x) doesn't represent a function call in the mathematical sense - it means that I'm taking the computer/source code M, putting the value x in memory, and then allowing it to run. If I say something like x = M(y), that means I took the value y, put it into M's memory, allowed it to run, and then once it's done take the resulting stuff in memory and put it into x.\n\n*Quines*\n\nTo simplify the structure, I'm going to use the existence of a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\\)) - a computer that prints its own source code. The details aren't too important, but the upshot is that all computer can have a subroutine I'll call GETMYCODE(), which simply puts its own source code into memory.\n\nSo, if I did something like this:\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYCODE()\n      PRINT(x)\n    }\n\nIt would print out\n    x = GETMYCODE()\n    PRINT(x)\n\n*'Weak' Halting Problem*\n\nI'm also going to simplify the type of halting problem we have.

I'm going to ask a narrower question \"Is there a computer which, when given source code that takes no input, can determine whether that code will halt when run?\"\n\nIt turns these are equivalent questions, in the sense that each can prove the other. However, I prefer the second, because it's easier to think about.\n\n**The Proof**\n\nWe want to prove that such a halting decider doesn't exist.\n\nSo, let's take a random machine H(x). We don't know what it does, but we know it takes some source code as input, and we know when it's done running it will put in memory either \"true\" or \"false\".\n\nSo, let's use the source code of H in our own code, and write a machine that looks like this\n\n    M() {\n      x = GETMYOWNCODE()\n      answer = H(x)\n      if answer is \"true\", loop\n      otherwise, halt\n    }\n\nAnd let's consider running H(&lt;M&gt;) - that is, H(x = GETMYOWNCODE(); answer = H(x); if answer is \"true\", loop; otherwise, halt). If the result of that is true, then when we actually run M() it will loop forever. If the result of that is false, then when we run M() it will halt. So, whatever this particular H answers, this particular M does the opposite - H is not a halting decider for M, which means it's not a halting decider at all (since a halting decider must always be right).\n\nNow, we proved this only for a single H. However, we didn't really use any information about H. We didn't assume any of its internals, except that it has some source code we could reuse. We also didn't assume what its output would be - our proof considers both options. This means that the same proof could be applied to every single machine - every machine is not the halting decider.

I teach five year olds. (XD) So if we assume the singularity has occurred already, then we must have found out more about consciousness than we already know. It\u2019s difficult to say whether the biological brain is more than the sum of input/output of information, motor control, and interpretation/ production of chemicals meant to drive the body towards a particular evolutionarily beneficial behavior. If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we\u2019d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I\u2019m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of... Could we call it a species? Could we call it intelligent? Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call \u201call too human\u201d which have plagued us for as long as we have been? With no space for subconsciousness or biases, with no ego, and with the ability to process information exponentially faster than the creatures which came before, with unlimited access to information, and the capability to increase storage space AS DESIRED, would there even be anything left to strive for? Oh, Timmy, I may have gotten a little bit existential. It wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nVery tough to make a call there. \n1. The new being is most likely it\u2019s own category now. What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature\u2019s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new \u201cspecies\u201d would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. \n\n2. If we kind of upgrade the existing frame with a new engine, a more modern dashboard, etc. then it\u2019s 100% the same species, in the same evolutionary chain.\n\n3. The reason I say new category in #1 is\u2014 what do people consider their deity/deities right now? Deity is not the best word here, but regardless of personal beliefs/truths about the beginnings of life, we would 100% be creators. Can you consider a creator to be of the same species? \n\nEh bottom line for me, Timmy.

Without going too much in to chemistry they have properties that make them more likely to be inert: f.i they have a decent number of electrons in their orbitals. They neither want to give away orbitals nor add any, they are content. Other elements might have 6 electrons when they *Really* want to have 8. Another might have 10.

The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the\u00a0Big Bang, through the process called\u00a0Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75%\u00a0hydrogen, 24%\u00a0helium\u00a0by mass. The rest is traces of other elements such as\u00a0lithium\u00a0and the hydrogen\u00a0isotope\u00a0deuterium. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.\n\nHeavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to\u00a0fuse\u00a0light elements to heavier ones in their\u00a0cores, giving off energy in the process, known as\u00a0stellar nucleosynthesis. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including\u00a0iron\u00a0and\u00a0nickel, and these elements are ejected into space (the\u00a0interstellar medium) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as\u00a0white dwarfs. The remains of their ejected mass form the\u00a0planetary nebulae\u00a0observable throughout our galaxy.\n\nSupernova nucleosynthesis\u00a0within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between\u00a0magnesium\u00a0(atomic number 12) and\u00a0nickel\u00a0(atomic number 28).[1]\u00a0Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a\u00a0type II supernova\u00a0event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic process) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the\u00a0r-process) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.\n\nNeutron star mergers\u00a0and collisions are also very responsible for many heavy elements, via the\u00a0r-process\u00a0(\"r\" stands for \"rapid\"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of\u00a0supernovae, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed\u00a0neutrons. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of\u00a0GW170817\u00a0led to the detection of substantial signatures of\u00a0gold,\u00a0platinum\u00a0and other heavy elements over an extended period.\n\nCosmic ray spallation, caused when\u00a0cosmic rays\u00a0impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly\u00a03He,\u00a09Be and\u00a010,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via\u00a0radiogenesis\u00a0(decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called\u00a0cosmogenic nuclides.\""}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bz6395/eli5_in_chemistry_why_are_they_called_the_noble/", "post_id": "bz6395"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: How Going Vegan Will Save The Environment"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Farming animals on the scales we do uses a vast amount of resources - feed, water, electricity, fuel.

Think of time as if it was another physical dimension, like a ladder you can just go up (forward in time) or go down (back in time), the only issue is we have no way of interacting with this dimension, rendering us as merely observers \u201cfalling down\u201d forever.\n\nThere are, though, certain particles such as electrons that can actually move through time in a non-linear way (this is something called quantum tunneling). A great analogy to understand this is by picturing the electron as a person trapped inside the bottom of a well, with a ladder outside the well. In order to escape the well, you need the ladder, which is outside, problem is, in order to get the ladder you need to be outside, so there is no possible way, right?

My explaination is based off the assumption that people will usually care more about characters that have more development.

The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the\u00a0Big Bang, through the process called\u00a0Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75%\u00a0hydrogen, 24%\u00a0helium\u00a0by mass. The rest is traces of other elements such as\u00a0lithium\u00a0and the hydrogen\u00a0isotope\u00a0deuterium. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.\n\nHeavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to\u00a0fuse\u00a0light elements to heavier ones in their\u00a0cores, giving off energy in the process, known as\u00a0stellar nucleosynthesis. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including\u00a0iron\u00a0and\u00a0nickel, and these elements are ejected into space (the\u00a0interstellar medium) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as\u00a0white dwarfs. The remains of their ejected mass form the\u00a0planetary nebulae\u00a0observable throughout our galaxy.\n\nSupernova nucleosynthesis\u00a0within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between\u00a0magnesium\u00a0(atomic number 12) and\u00a0nickel\u00a0(atomic number 28).[1]\u00a0Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a\u00a0type II supernova\u00a0event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic process) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the\u00a0r-process) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.\n\nNeutron star mergers\u00a0and collisions are also very responsible for many heavy elements, via the\u00a0r-process\u00a0(\"r\" stands for \"rapid\"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of\u00a0supernovae, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed\u00a0neutrons. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of\u00a0GW170817\u00a0led to the detection of substantial signatures of\u00a0gold,\u00a0platinum\u00a0and other heavy elements over an extended period.\n\nCosmic ray spallation, caused when\u00a0cosmic rays\u00a0impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly\u00a03He,\u00a09Be and\u00a010,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via\u00a0radiogenesis\u00a0(decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called\u00a0cosmogenic nuclides.\""}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bz6395/eli5_in_chemistry_why_are_they_called_the_noble/", "post_id": "bz6395"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: How Going Vegan Will Save The Environment"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "You'd have to throw a big tarp over the entire arctic tundra to do that.

The ones that later turn into cancer or another disease when those errors in each copy become more and more severe.\n\nWith that basic understanding in place. Yes fasting with help the gut microbiome and general health although much is still unknown.

Lifetime of easy nutrition advice. \n\nSure IF has some benefits to it but it's really not proven to be substantially better over the long term than any other diet BUT that is not really what matters.

When your life circumstances change, your diet will likely eventually grow and change, too. And that's a great thing!

That's effectively putting your company under government sanctions. \n\n&gt;Sorry again im not trying to pester, just playing devil's advocate so I can get a handle on how the tax works to achieve it's end goal of less carbon emission.\n\nNo need to apologize, these things are important to understand, and reasoned debate can help everyone understand the benefits, drawbacks, and pitfalls of any policy.\n\nBasic economics asserts that you can reduce consumption of a good if you raise the price, but in practice, it depends a great deal on what that good is. Take health care in the USA. The prices have been relentlessly rising, yet consumption of that suite of goods has not reduced at all. The critical issue is \"substitute goods\". If I want to make America eat fewer oranges, and levy an orange tax, Americans can easily respond by eating tangerines or grapefruits or mandarins. So the real question of the carbon tax is this, \"How viable are the substitute goods?\" The answer to that, for carbon, is complicated. In some cases, they're very viable, in others, not so much.\n\nIn the end, personally, I'm in favor of the carbon tax, because it's a non-prescriptive answer to how to reduce our emissions and (hopefully) achieve some ecological equilibrium. I don't think it will be perfect, because I don't believe in perfect policies or institutions, but I do think it's preferable to the status quo (doing nothing)."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Ok, I understand that and think you have a good point about alternatives.

If you have a big SUV, you're not going to immediately junk your car and buy a newer, smaller, fuel-efficient vehicle. So it's going to take time for these measures to take effect.\n\n&gt;Economics would dictate that the businesses who are selling fuel would just continue to increase the price until there is no more increase in revenue, or product sales begin to dwindle.\n\nWell, gas is a commodity, so it's actually a very competitive market. That's why gas prices fluctuate so wildly when the price of petrol fluctuates on the market, the margins on selling gas are incredibly low. That already indicates that any price increase to the seller will be passed onto the buyer. In point of fact, however, we've already seen how increasing fuel prices can change people's behavior. During the oil crisis in the 1970's, American began buying smaller, more fuel-efficient cars because the price of gas was getting high. It was this market shift which toppled American auto-makers from their control of the U.S. domestic auto market, as upstarts like Honda and Toyota came in with their Civics and Celicas. However, as oil prices fell back as supply recovered, and as more fuel-efficient vehicles were brought to market, larger vehicles have become more popular.\n\nOne last thing to consider is that for most of the market, energy is fungible. Transportation is just one piece. If you make carbon expensive, power companies will invest in less-carbon-emitting alternatives, and they have the kind of long-term outlook to make those investments as soon as the laws are enacted."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Ok, so would it be safe to say that the goal of a carbon tax is to make carbon emitting tech/industries unviable in the long term, thus driving companies to innovate and consumers to change their habits for greener alternatives (that we hope are coming from innovation)?\n\nAlso...

In the 1950's, the U.S.A.'s mass transit systems were systematically dismantled by auto-makers, so as to promote car sales. Now, in most places, mass transit is de-facto welfare, ie: built and maintained at taxpayer expense to support the elderly, disabled, and poor. But that's not how it has to be. Many countries boast excellent mass transit systems, making living without a car not only viable, but desirable. Hong Kong's mass transit system is actually a huge source of revenue for the enclave, for example.\n\n&gt;Also...

The singularity is the \"center point\" or point of infinite density where the math breaks down.

The bloom protects the shells from allowing air and moisture from diffusing through the shell freely (in both directions), and also acts as an antimicrobial.

The complexity (dimensions) of a character can be determined by many factors. Some could be their actions, reactions, way of life, thinking, etc. Mostly things that define a character and make them special and different from other characters. Ofcourse non complex characters can have charactistics that make them different from others but sometimes those characters feel like they have those characteristics just to be different rather than to be a good character. Another factor is the characters back story or their history. The history of a characters should support why they are who they are.

If the characters parents were killed by criminals but they tried to be nice to criminals that wouldnt make too much sense.

Maybe I got the story wrong, so I'll just take your word for it for the sake of discussion.\n\nIt sounds like we're saying the same thing--Europeans and Native Americans had different immune systems due to what diseases they had been exposed to. But I'm puzzled why you'd think that those differences were a racial difference.  \"Race\" implies a genetic, heritable difference, one that is innate to a person and to all of the people of the same race. But the immunity to disease is an acquired, environmental difference. It doesn't derive from having Native American ancestry. If a newborn Native American were teleported to Europe in 1600 and raised there, that individual would likely have the same disease immunity that a person of Germany ancestry. And if a newborn Irish kid had been teleported to 1600 American continent, they'd almost certainly die along with 90-95% of the Native American  inhabitants of the eastern US in the plague that occurred in that time and place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don't understand the need to go about arguing that we're all the same exact thing. A fair white person will sunburn more easily than a dark black person. Does this example not suffice that we're biologically different? Why do I have to start listing out examples until we find one that works. You must firmly believe that we are physiologically identical to each other, otherwise you wouldn't make me go through such trouble for debate.\n\nI think you're misrepresenting the position of people who are saying that race is a cultural, not biological, construct. No one is arguing that a white person and a black person react the same to the sun. What they're saying is that the criteria that are ascribed to divide people into different groups are false; that the distinct categorizations of peoples into races does not reflect true biological differences. There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there's zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn't in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable. Change can be confusing and stressful so saying that this is just the way things are, and that the way I personally see the world is unambiguously, completely accurately, THE way the world IS, is comforting. \n\nBut there are a lot more genetic differences within a given race than between different races. Also, virtually all humans who are descended from people from outside sub-Saharan Africa are quite similar, as compared to the differences between any 2 people of different villages in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, modern humans, it seems, evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then a small subset of those people left Africa and populated the rest of the planet. All the differences you see among Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, etc., all come from this small subset of people that left Africa.  Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it's simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that's false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you'd have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don't like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let's think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that's a bit weird because you're ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it's like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it's not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they're the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it's just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let's accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don't fall into distinct groups as if they're separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it's very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There's a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There's no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you're black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there's no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let's choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don't. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It's just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn't. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don't equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren't inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Very long wall of text, but I appreciate the time you took to write it for me.\n\nFrom the way that you put it, it seems like it\u2019s almost impossible to start categorizing all of humankind taxonomically. I gather that this is such a large task because we are all so similar. That no one is saying we are identical, but our differences are very, very small. \n\nI guess the only question I have left for you is to suppose there were no cultural importance placed on certain genes and we were able to look at ourselves like the animals we technically are, is there a case to be made for classifying us then\u2014 maybe consider the ones doing the classifying are aliens just observing us, with no stake in the matter.

Just because you are a side character doesnt mean you dont get development. Thats a double standard (i think i used that term correctly). Its the same for a main character. Just because you are a main character doesnt mean you will always get development.\n\nRather than looking at the characters importance in the story first, i think acknowledging they are a character first, and a main character second is better. After youve acknowledged that you are looking at a character that might or might not be a main character, you should look at the characters complexity.

Sometimes the stereotype is just a bonus to an already great character. \n\nSummary: First, although your summary is sometimes correct, that doesnt make it true for all stories.

My explaination is based off the assumption that people will usually care more about characters that have more development. Its also based off the assumption that *usually* more important characters will usually have more complexity meaning complex characters are often main characters (but *not always*). The dimensions of a character is solely based off the complexity of a character.

The problem is that when you install those parts, you must use proprietary software to make those parts work. This is the problem.  Manufacturers restrict this software to a select group (such as dealerships, for cars). This destroys independent business.  It also allows the manufacturer to have a monopoly on repair, charging anything they want.\n\nIn the case of farm equipment, if your giant combine harvester breaks down in the field, you can no longer repair it: you must wait for a service technician to arrive with the right parts and software.  If there is a delay?  We'll, your crops rot and you starve.\n\nThe right to repair is not about shitty consumer electronics like iphones.  It's about owning a piece of equipment that you rely on for your livelihood breaking down, and then your livelihood becomes dependent on some megacorp monopoly fixing that piece of equipment for an insane amount of money, on their schedule, not yours.  This is a piece of equipment that you own!  \n\nWhite goods (appliances) and consumer electronics are a secondary consideration."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "&gt; If there is a delay?  We'll, your crops rot and you starve.\n\nIs very extreme...  But I get your point. \n\nMy only question then is around software, some people here have mentioned that people should have the right to edit the software and considering that code is more of a Janga tower I kinda agree with the company that software shouldn't be touched."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "On you first comment, that my post is a bit extreme; it's not.  Pre-computer era tractors (1950's - 1990's) are commanding premiums on the market specifically because they are repairable.\n\nOn your second point, I also disagree.  Hardware and software both should be able to be modified if you own the product.  There is no difference.  If you screw it up, that's on you.  \n\nHowever, as a concession, I will say that if companies don't want anyone to modify the software on the product, they should make the software available for purchase just like an oem (original equipment manufacturer) part.  Really, if they care that much about the software, it should be available for free."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Your forgetting one thing.

This is the fundamental concept behind right to repair.  You may well put your trust in large corporations, that they have your best interest in mind, but most do not.  \n\nAt any rate, once again, you are missing the larger picture.  Nobody gives a shit about the security of the source code of their combine harvester.  They just want it to work when they need it to work."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Open source software is protected by the fact that it is built in the \u201copen\u201d and millions of people look and work on it together. You can\u2019t expect a private company to predict bugs with only a few thousand engineers. Not to mention... Open software is often the victim of hacks and attacks. \n\nRegardless.. I do care about the network security of a tractor, does it have GPS? Does it record harvesting patterns? Can it be sabotaged by a competitor or a troll? \n\nI believe in the right to repair, but after this discussion what I\u2019ve learned is it\u2019s so arbitrary.\nSome people want the warranty on an iPhone to be valid even if you replace a button with a knockoff brand. Some people just want software to work even if you do use an off brand replacement part. Some people seem to want companies to be forced to provide their own parts to the public. There are even comments here that say that all software provided by companies should be open giving the public the ability to edit source code themselves. \n\nThis explain like I\u2019m five has basically led to me realising that the movement has no direction, and as with all movements without a clear goal or direction it will most likely fail."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "I think you are still missing something; people want control over the items that they pay for - as it has been since people started manufacturing and buying products.\n\nYou buy the product, it's yours to do as you wish.\n\n This is the goal of the movement.\n\nSoftware has changed the picture, sure.  But it doesn't change the fact that not everyone wants to be assimilated into the borg.  This is about full control by the manufacturer - if it were not, simple versions of items would be available that did not require this litigation; but for the most part, they are not.  Can a farmer buy a new tractor without all the whizzbang doodads?  \n\nNot really.  Hence the skyrocketing prices for older equipment.  Same with cars.  Not everyone wants a flipping cellphone on wheels, but that's what we are getting.  Add to that, planned obsolescence, and you, the consumer are caught in a never-ending cycle of having your money siphoned out of your pockets.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to rant.

However, they did these things as a monarchy with strong support for aristocrats and aristocratic tradition. No one considered them left wing, even though they had a lot of socialist elements present. \n\nPart of the issue in this discussion is that there are multiple terms that are sometimes used to mean the same thing, and sometimes used to mean different things. \n\nFor example, if we were to use the traditional 2D political chart with the Authoritarian-Libertarian axis describing how strong the government is, and the Left-Right axis describing the economic system, then the Nazi Party would be Authoritarian and Centrist to center-left on the economic spectrum. In this case, Left solely refers to economic system. However, this makes the Nazi Party seem like it was just short of the Communist Party of the USSR. You could certainly make the argument that they *were/are* the same thing, yet most people would say that the Nazi Party and other fascists were right-wing, while the Communists were left-wing. \n\nThis gets into the fact that left and right wing can be and are often used to refer to **multiple measures.** \n\nWe can say that Communists and Nazis/Fascists were both Authoritarian in that they supported a really strong state. We can say that they were both  Communists and Nazis/Fascists had planned economies and thus were on the left of the economic spectrum.\n\nHowever, we can say that the actual policies and goals of the two groups were extremely different. The USSR, at least under Lenin, was internationalist and multi-ethnic, with the goal of eliminating classes. They killed off the monarchy and the aristocracy. Under Hitler, Germany was nationalist and an ethno-state, with the goal of establishing new classes based on race.

It\u2019s difficult to say whether the biological brain is more than the sum of input/output of information, motor control, and interpretation/ production of chemicals meant to drive the body towards a particular evolutionarily beneficial behavior. If this is all the brain is, then the singularity would not have broken the evolutionary chain, in my opinion, although we\u2019d be looking at a new species. Similarly, chimpanzees and several other primates are from the same evolutionary chain as humans. If there were something other than these parts, plus others I\u2019m not mentioning for the sake of simplicity/ my own ignorance/ impatience, that we were unable to translate into a silicone based mechanical brain, then it would not be fair to say that they were in the same evolutionary chain, because the new being would be an entirely different type of... Could we call it a species? Could we call it intelligent? Would we need to redefine intelligence to allow space for this, or create a new word for something unhindered by the flaws which have held back humans, indeed the traits we call \u201call too human\u201d which have plagued us for as long as we have been? With no space for subconsciousness or biases, with no ego, and with the ability to process information exponentially faster than the creatures which came before, with unlimited access to information, and the capability to increase storage space AS DESIRED, would there even be anything left to strive for? Oh, Timmy, I may have gotten a little bit existential. It wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nVery tough to make a call there. \n1. The new being is most likely it\u2019s own category now. What is intelligence? What is a species? All species currently are driven by nature\u2019s demand to reproduce. Programming this into a new \u201cspecies\u201d would be ethically questionable, because look what life is currently doing to this planet. Not programming this in, the new species would likely feel no purpose, if it feels at all. \n\n2. If we kind of upgrade the existing frame with a new engine, a more modern dashboard, etc. then it\u2019s 100% the same species, in the same evolutionary chain.\n\n3.

Deity is not the best word here, but regardless of personal beliefs/truths about the beginnings of life, we would 100% be creators.

I think it is more intuitive to think of a piston in an internal combustion engine: the fuel is ignited and its volume/pressure increases, the force of the pressure pushes on the piston which is moving in a direction, that is work transferring energy from the pressure of the gas to the motion of the piston while the pressure is decreasing as the volume expands.\n\nThe temperature does not do the work; work is the integral of force along a distance."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "&gt;The temperature does not do the work; work is the integral of force along a distance.\n\nYeah this is exactly what I mean.

At least for me, it makes it a bit more intuitive to think about because it does not involve heating/cooling and phase changes. The same fundamental energy transfers apply to both though. \n\nSince we agree that temperature does not matter, I won't mention it again.\n\nThe act of boiling the water increases the pressure of the gas, this is analogous to pushing down on the plunger of a bike pump to increase the pressure of the gas. Now, imagine you have a little valve you can open to release a stream of that pressurized gas and shoot it at a pinwheel to make it spin. The pressure of the gas in the pump drops as it passes through the valve (and the gas speeds up), then that fast stream of gas smacks into the pinwheel and makes it spin (while the gas slows down in the process). \n\nYou then have to collect that gas and spend some energy to bring it back to the initial conditions so you can repeat the cycle. The useful work you get out is the difference between the work the gas does on the turbine and the work you have to put back in to reset the system.\n\nSame thing is happening in a closed water cycle with turbines and condensers. \n\nIn this analogy, you could imagine two differently designed pumps, where one stroke on each creates a different pressure at the outlet. Can think of a big ass pump a foot in diameter vs a tiny ass pump an inch diameter. One stroke on each will produce a different output.\n This is somewhat analogous to the difference between water or acetone. For any given material, a given input of energy will boil a given mass of the material and result in a given change in the pressure of the gas.\n\nTaking it to the extreme end of poor performance, an imaginary material that boiled into a gas of the same volume as the liquid would not produce any change in pressure. It would not turn the turbine at all, but you would still have to cool it down again to reset the cycle ending up with a negative efficiency. \n\nSo again, it is the change in pressure that drives the whole process. Water just happens to be efficient for producing large changes in pressure between the liquid and vapor phases for a given input of energy.   In a perfect world, we would have some material that suddenly expands to a gas of 10 million times the liquid volume with very little heat input and is non-toxic and cheap and all of this happens near room temperature.

Gaseous steam has the potential to absorb a lot of that energy, so you want to absorb as much of it as possible.Of course, there is a huge burst of power when liquid water is converted to a gas. However once it is converted to a gas, it still has the potential to expand more from absorbing heat. If you constrain the gas so it cannot expand, the pressure goes up. The turbines that convert the gas energy into a spinning shaft operate off of the difference in pressure between the inlet and the outlet. I phrase it that way so I can add a fascinating bit about the stages of energy drawn off by the turbine sets. You'd think the steam would be passed through a large single turbine, but there are often more of them in series. \n\nA fairly common arrangement on a ship would be a small high-pressure turbine, then the exhaust is directed to a large medium-pressure turbine. (medium-pressure acting on large turbine blades produce the same shaft torque as high-pressure acting on small turbine blades). Fairly low pressure steam (still a gas) comes out the exhaust.\n\nHere's the wacky part. After the steam reaches the end of the line (farther down), it is cooled to condense it back into hot liquid water. The chamber in which the steam condenses into liquid will draw a partial vacuum. Do we throw that vacuum away?
