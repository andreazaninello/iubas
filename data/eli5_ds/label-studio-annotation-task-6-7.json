General speaking though most birds evolved from the surviving dinosaurs, which evolved from smaller reptiles, then back to fish, before that was various sea life back and back to single-celled organisms and bacteria. And that's just life on our planet. Which most likely arrived here on meteorites which brought frozen water that now fills our oceans. That theory is called \"Panspermia\"\n\nUniversally though, one theory is our 3 dimensional universe was created due to the collapse and blackhole of a 4th dimensional star. I might not be able to explain this super clear but it should give you a starting point if you want to do more research. So in our current universe there are black holes made when supermassive stars implode. It's not really a \"hole\" so much as a \"well\" in the fabric of spacetime. The singularity is the \"center point\" or point of infinite density where the math breaks down. Then in a sphere around that is the \"event horizon\" the line that nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull anymore.

I've heard a lot of talk recently about how it's the safest and most efficient, but I know absolutely nothing."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "It's not that nuclear is the most efficient per se, but that it provides the most power per unit mass (also known as energy density) as compared to any other power source. For coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear this is measured in kilowatt hours per cubic meter, while for solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other renewable sources, it's measured in kilowatt hours per square meter. [This paper explains a bit about the difference, and how the conversion works.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233231163_A_Comparison_of_Energy_Densities_of_Prevalent_Energy_Sources_in_Units_of_Joules_Per_Cubic_Meter) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, [let's talk a little bit about load profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_profile). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnywhere in the world is going to have peaks and dips in the electrical demand, based on human activity, time of day, time of year, temperature, and dozens of other factors. Not all power plants are made equally, and not all are best at meeting all load demands at all times. There are a few basic types of electrical loads that are on the grid at any given time, of which I'll touch on a couple briefly:\n\n* [Base load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load) is the minimum load that's always present on the grid - this is measured over a time span by a utility or regulatory body and is very reliable in terms of what the actual demand is over long periods of time. This can be represented by your home refrigerator and freezer that's always running, regardless of how many frozen meals you have squeezed in your freezer door. **Large power plants**, i.e. nuclear, coal, and large hydropower sites are best suited to meet this load demand. This is because these large plants are most economical when they're running constantly at a high load factor (meeting large loads), and they are slow to react to rapid changes or fluctuations in power because of several factors that are outside this scope (but which I'd be happy to talk about later). \n* [Peak demand load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand) is the load on the grid that occurs at a single point during a day- in winter it could be first thing in the morning as heaters are turned on, or in summer it could be in mid to late afternoon as air conditioning units are working their hardest based on outside temperature. This load has to be anticipated, and there are forecasting models that can help determine what the window is for when the peak will occur. Because it will be an instantaneous process, there need to be power sources online that can meet the peak when it hits. Smaller power plants, or what we call **peaker plants**, are often used to meet this demand. Gas turbines powered by natural gas or oil are often currently used to meet this demand, but they're horribly expensive per unit energy, have a lower capacity factor, and still have to be spun up and brought online beforehand (though this can be done in usually half an hour to an hour, as opposed to the days or multiple hours it will take to start up a nuclear or coal power plant). This is an application we're seeing more and more interest with regards to solar or wind, especially when paired with an energy storage system (i.e. batteries). \n\nNow, speaking of costs of power plants. Nuclear is horrifically expensive, for a number of reasons. Choosing a site for a plant has to be done very, very carefully, with regards to rights of way, access to a cooling medium (lake, river, coastal zone), seismic considerations, and distance from population centers, to name a few. In addition, very little of the land surrounding a site can be repurposed for other uses over the life of the plant. By contrast, solar can be installed in a variety of places, and the land can be devoted to other uses at the same time. Wind is much the same way- yes, individual wind turbines need a lot of space, but the land between them can be used for other purposes, currently such as farming or grazing. Construction costs for nuclear are also much, much higher, due to the very specialized nature of the work and materials required, the reporting criteria during the construction process, and the massive number of people needed to build a plant. In addition, operating costs are also higher due to the number of highly trained (and thus highly paid) operators needed to operate, administrate, and maintain a plant, and to periodically conduct refueling operations. **Finally, there's the question of fuel disposal**. This isn't nearly as big of a crisis as most everybody thinks it is, and[we've had the solution for what to do with spent fuel for quite a few years now](https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/27032/GE-nuclear-reactor-waste). Unfortunately, the politics of the uninformed has driven a lot of the policy around reprocessing spent fuel and nuclear power in general, and it's been to the detriment of literally everybody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, we need both nuclear and renewables, but for very different purposes and reasons. We need new nuclear plants to replace existing coal and oil-fired plants for base loading, especially as the population continues to grow. We need renewable sources to better respond to intermediate and peak loads, and to provide a greater diversity of load to help power all of our \"gadgets,\" especially as plug-in electric cars continue to gain more and more popularity. And just as urgently, we need more flexible power grids that can be adaptable and expandable to both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this answers your question."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "This was extremely interesting and thorough.

Is its use going to be steadily increasing in the coming years? I heard it's pretty much all about battery space still, like one comment said. Don't know if that's legitimate from inside the industry, though.\n\nThis is an excellent follow-up question!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short answer:** solar power isn't going anywhere except up. As prices drop and technology improves, we'll continue to see more and more installations happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Longer answer:** there are a lot of technical issues being addressed in a variety of directions to make solar more viable. Because of the size and scale of a lot of installations, a lot of work is being done in [smart grid](https://blog.schneider-electric.com/smart-grid/2018/06/12/how-solar-power-gets-a-boost-with-smart-grid-solutions/) and [microgrid](https://www.energy.gov/articles/how-microgrids-work) technologies that will provide more adaptability and smaller-scale ability to control and apply the power they're generating. In addition, [work in power electronics and high voltage DC systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5545743) are helping to create more flexibility for interconnections and purely DC loads (i.e. cell phones, computers, electric cars, LED lighting, etc) to reduce some of the conversion losses and again provide better monitoring and control. \n\nIn other areas, as the grid is becoming more decentralized in general due to [a variety of distributed energy resources](https://blog.aee.net/distributed-energy-resources-101-required-reading-for-a-modern-grid) being brought online in a variety of industries across the board, this is helping drive changes within the electric utility industry, in terms of how they regulate and dispatch power, as well as how they allow permitting for these various sources. It's also opening the door for things like [community solar projects](https://www.energysage.com/solar/community-solar/community-solar-power-explained/), which are gaining more and more popularity with smaller municipalities and towns as citizens look to how they can help reduce their own carbon footprints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps answer this question, and let me know if you have any others!"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Interesting.

The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the\u00a0Big Bang, through the process called\u00a0Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75%\u00a0hydrogen, 24%\u00a0helium\u00a0by mass. The rest is traces of other elements such as\u00a0lithium\u00a0and the hydrogen\u00a0isotope\u00a0deuterium. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.\n\nHeavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to\u00a0fuse\u00a0light elements to heavier ones in their\u00a0cores, giving off energy in the process, known as\u00a0stellar nucleosynthesis. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including\u00a0iron\u00a0and\u00a0nickel, and these elements are ejected into space (the\u00a0interstellar medium) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as\u00a0white dwarfs. The remains of their ejected mass form the\u00a0planetary nebulae\u00a0observable throughout our galaxy.\n\nSupernova nucleosynthesis\u00a0within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between\u00a0magnesium\u00a0(atomic number 12) and\u00a0nickel\u00a0(atomic number 28).[1]\u00a0Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a\u00a0type II supernova\u00a0event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy (endothermic process) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the\u00a0r-process) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.\n\nNeutron star mergers\u00a0and collisions are also very responsible for many heavy elements, via the\u00a0r-process\u00a0(\"r\" stands for \"rapid\"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of\u00a0supernovae, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed\u00a0neutrons. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of\u00a0GW170817\u00a0led to the detection of substantial signatures of\u00a0gold,\u00a0platinum\u00a0and other heavy elements over an extended period.\n\nCosmic ray spallation, caused when\u00a0cosmic rays\u00a0impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly\u00a03He,\u00a09Be and\u00a010,11B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via\u00a0radiogenesis\u00a0(decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called\u00a0cosmogenic nuclides.\""}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bz6395/eli5_in_chemistry_why_are_they_called_the_noble/", "post_id": "bz6395"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: Would men who get genetalia amputees still have sexual urges?

Would it stay in the body unless there was sweat to evaporate? Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info? \n  \nReleasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears.\nWhile your body also loses heat by other means (heat radiation and simple heat transfer to surrounding materials), evaporation energy lost to sweat evaporation is usually orders of magnitude bigger."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Thanks a lot for the technical, yet very clear explanation. \n\nI asked because I'm reading Bill Gates's new book on climate change.

I'm trying to apply what you told me to make sense of this. According to the book, \"the human body's ability to cool off depends on the air's ability to absorb sweat as it evaporates. If the air cannot absorb your sweat, then it can t cool you off, no matter how much you perspire.\" \n\nDoesn't the fact that the sweat evaporated mean that you have been cooled off?

The sweat will stay in liquid form and not provide any cooling effect.  \nThink of the water vapor within the air as some kind of *solution*. If you add salt into a glass of water the salt will dissolve. If you *keep* adding salt the water will reach 100% salt saturation at some point and the salt - instead of dissolving - will stay in its solid form and accumulate at the bottom of the glass.

Most people probably don't.    \n\n\nSimply put it is a structure which in its ground state oscillates in time instead of space.  \n\n\nTo start simply a crystal is basically a structure with a repeating pattern.  As you move through the structure you come across pieces of it at regular intervals. So a crystal repeats in space, a time crystal repeats in time. It is able to change regularly between different configurations or arrangements of its structure while in its lowest energy state.  Lowest energy state means the energy isn't able to be used for work, meaning you can't use the energy or withdraw it from the crystal.  When these crystals are acted upon by an outside frequency, let's say an energy pulse hits it, they resonate, or change configuration of the structure, repeatedly back and forth between these configurations, but not in the expected symmetric way. They break symmetry.  For example instead of one pulse of energy repeating back through the crystal as one pulse, back and forth between configurations, it may repeat as a fractional pulse, the value of which depends on the structure of the crystal. In a perfect time crystal the changing back and forth should likely continue indefinitely.

Carbon starts with four, so it needs to share four more with other atoms to hit eight. For the same reasons, nitrogen, with five, likes to form 3 bonds, and oxygen, with six, likes to form two. (This is only a rule of thumb and by no means a guarantee.)\n\nFor more on this, uh, take a chemistry class. It gets complicated!

Carbon-carbon bonds are symmetric, while hydrogen-oxygen bonds usually aren't (the electrons get pulled closer to the oxygen).\n\n&gt; Are four bonds necessary for the life we know about on earth?\n\nThe fact that it forms long chains is really the more important point, but the fourth bond does help. It allows organic molecules (in chemistry, this is just a term for molecules built off of carbon chains) to branch off of one another in complex ways. If it only formed three bonds, for example, then you could only hang one extra thing off the carbon-carbon chain (since two bonds get taken up with the carbons on either side), whereas in the world in which we actually live, you can hang two different things off of each carbon and still have two bonds left over to maintain the chain.\n\n&gt; Why is forming a bond to itself beneficial?\n\nBiological molecules are big. They mostly have to be: they need to be so big that little details of their structure are bigger than whole other molecules, so that they can control the behavior of those other molecules.

So it's going to take time for these measures to take effect.\n\n&gt;Economics would dictate that the businesses who are selling fuel would just continue to increase the price until there is no more increase in revenue, or product sales begin to dwindle.\n\nWell, gas is a commodity, so it's actually a very competitive market. That's why gas prices fluctuate so wildly when the price of petrol fluctuates on the market, the margins on selling gas are incredibly low. That already indicates that any price increase to the seller will be passed onto the buyer. In point of fact, however, we've already seen how increasing fuel prices can change people's behavior. During the oil crisis in the 1970's, American began buying smaller, more fuel-efficient cars because the price of gas was getting high. It was this market shift which toppled American auto-makers from their control of the U.S. domestic auto market, as upstarts like Honda and Toyota came in with their Civics and Celicas. However, as oil prices fell back as supply recovered, and as more fuel-efficient vehicles were brought to market, larger vehicles have become more popular.\n\nOne last thing to consider is that for most of the market, energy is fungible. Transportation is just one piece. If you make carbon expensive, power companies will invest in less-carbon-emitting alternatives, and they have the kind of long-term outlook to make those investments as soon as the laws are enacted."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Ok, so would it be safe to say that the goal of a carbon tax is to make carbon emitting tech/industries unviable in the long term, thus driving companies to innovate and consumers to change their habits for greener alternatives (that we hope are coming from innovation)?\n\nAlso...

In the 1950's, the U.S.A.'s mass transit systems were systematically dismantled by auto-makers, so as to promote car sales. Now, in most places, mass transit is de-facto welfare, ie: built and maintained at taxpayer expense to support the elderly, disabled, and poor. But that's not how it has to be. Many countries boast excellent mass transit systems, making living without a car not only viable, but desirable. Hong Kong's mass transit system is actually a huge source of revenue for the enclave, for example.\n\n&gt;Also...

How did he ever start?\n\nAnd yet, we do it. Our fingers make it all the way from at rest to the next key on the keyboard, we make it from our beds to the refrigerators, all while crossing an infinite number of points between here and there.

He only just started so he might've explained some things wrong but I feel like I understood the idea and it seemed to fit right in with the impossible nature of reality, the fact that reality itself is relative, it seems like the only logical explanation for reality, that it exists but doesn't at the same time, that existing and not existing are, really, the same thing. I'm not gonna comment too much on this because I've no knowledge on the topic of quantum mechanics, besides the couple of things my friend told me."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "&gt; Value, in what sense?\n\nValue in that if you had an infinite number of tokens, and each token had it's place in the set marked on it. So you have from the two sets one token that has 0.7 on it, but the second set has a token with 1.4 on it you won't find in the first. Everything in the first set is in the second set, but everything in the second set is not in the first, even though there are an infinite number of each of them.\n\nIn more mathematic terms, we can compare the integers to the reals. The integer set contains whole numbers, but real numbers also contain whole numbers and ratios of whole numbers. There are an infinite number of both, but 1.5 is not in the integer set. Further more, there are irrational numbers, which contain all the reals and numbers that are not ratios of integers, like Pi. Three sets, all infinite, but there are things in each that are not in the others. By definition, that means there are more in these bigger sets than the others.\n\n&gt; No infinites are real because infinite is a logically impossible concept, like Omnipotence\n\nBut you were the one talking about real infinities. Our universe is infinitely expansive, time is infinite. These things are real. There are conceptual infinities that have real world consequence that are also as real as it gets and that's good enough for me. Your computer is programmed assuming multiple infinities of different sizes. It wouldn't work without these concepts.\n\n&gt; But there wasn't more yard stick, if you start pairing up the pieces you will never get to a point where you have a piece in your hand you can't pair with any other.\n\nI don't know how to help you understand this statement is incorrect. Imagine the ruler and the yardstick both cut up an infinite number of times on a tray. You can pick up the whole tray and have an infinite number of pieces on it. So the tray containing the 12\" ruler has an infinite number of pieces, and you have all of it in one hand. Then take the tray with the yard stick on it, scoop up 12\" of it and separate it off. That too, is infinite, just like all the pieces of the ruler. It's the same length as the ruler, these pieces pair up 1:1, but yet on the other tray, there's the rest of the yard stick.\n\nI guess you may have to just accept as an axiom that you can talk about infinities as a whole is perfectly valid. Again, we're talking about set theory where this is perfectly fine, this is the basis of this branch of math that is true by definition.\n\nAnd you may notice with this last examples I've alluded to parts are as infinite as the whole, which is true. What do you get? Fractals - another consequence of infinities.\n\n&gt; I understand the experiment but I don't see the connection between it and the comparability of Infinity.\n\nI was going off on a tangent. Infinities are everywhere, and are a consequence of some interesting mathematical truths. The point here is that the concept of the infinite surface area but finite volume exists. It also illustrates important concepts of calculus, which I don't think you're going to argue doesn't exist.\n\nIn calculus, we measure the area under a curve, which has endless application in all sorts of stuff, in finance and physics, which are a couple things I've used it for. To measure this area, we perform an infinite number of approximations to get the area. The exercise is trivial, you can find calculus tutorials on YouTube that teach you all of calculus in 20 minutes. It's an exercise in infinities.\n\n&gt; I feel like I understood the idea and it seemed to fit right in with the impossible nature of reality\n\nAnd here I have to nit-pick your words. Impossible? And yet, here we are, discussing the apparent impossibility of infinity? It seems... Contradictory.\n\nYou're not seeing the forest for the trees. Stop looking at each countable item, and just accept that there are a lot - the actual amount, that there are an infinite number of them, is not actually important. Maybe then you can enjoy this whole field with the rest of us. There are absurd and preposterous mathematical truths that are real all over the place. In 3D video games and robotics, we use the 3D shadows of a 4D space to move our models and our robots through space. \"But space isn't 4D\" - it doesn't matter, in math, it doesn't matter, and it works. I'm trying to think of other crazy shit I've done in math for work... Oh! Bees! lol, yes bees. You know bees do a dance to tell the other bees where to find flowers? We knew it had something to do with the angle of the sun and some other bits, but we didn't have a mathematical model of their dancing until I think 2006. You see, their dance always follows the same predictable pattern until... I think it's if the flowers are super close to the hive, or the angle to the sun is too extreme, the dance changes into these weird circles no one could figure out. Enter 6D space. The dance makes perfect sense when you model it in 6D space and geometry. The dance is a 2D projection, which means you perform your 6D geometry, and you cast a shadow down into 5D space, and then that casts a shadow down into 4D, and 3D, and finally down into 2D, just like when you stick your hand in a light, and cast a 2D shadow of your 3D hand on the ground. What you get when you perform 6D navigation maths and boil it down to 2D is the bee's dance. And they're doing this near instantaneously in their little bee brains, which are specifically hard wired to do it.\n\nNow I'm just trying to blow your mind. Maths have all sorts of absurdities with very real world consequences. None of it is necessarily real, it's just us applying patterns we recognize to real world phenomena. I'm just trying to help you open your mind. Let go, and stop clinging to this notion about infinity and what you think you know, because there are plenty of us who aren't limited like you've limited yourself. Instead of trying to argue with me \"no\", how about you try to ask yourself \"what if or how could u/mredding and the others be right?

The most natural definition is that the size of a finite set = how many elements it has. This allows us to define what\u2019s called a bijection between 2 sets of the same size - basically, can I match up all of the objects in set A in one- to - one correspondence with the objects of set B? If I can, then clearly the number of elements is the same, and if not, then one set needs to have more elements than the other. \n\nWhen talking about infinite sets, it isn\u2019t meaningful to talk about how many elements they have by assigning a number value to them, so the first approach doesn\u2019t extend to infinite sets. But the second approach does- we can say two sets are the same size if I can match up their elements one-to-one with eachother. For example, I can match up the integers to the even numbers by the mapping n\u2014&gt; 2n. Ie, whatever integer I have, multiply it by 2. This gives me exactly one even number. To reverse it, just divide by any even number by 2- you get exactly one integer. Since I can do this process to any integer (or the reverse to any even number), the numbers are in one - to - one correspondence. \n\nNow, let\u2019s check if we can do the same with the natural numbers and the reals. Let\u2019s assume that we can, so there would be some arrangement by which we can label every real number by exactly one real number. We aren\u2019t sure what that arrangement is, but there has to be a \u201cfirst\u201d one, since there is a first natural number. For example, let\u2019s say it\u2019s 0.2847294017... Then there has to be a second, say 0.5972794826..., and so on. Now, we are assuming that we\u2019ve listed every real number that way; now, let\u2019s find a contradiction to that line of reasoning. If we can, then our assumption that there are as many natural numbers as there are reals must be false. \n\nSo, let\u2019s transform our numbers according to the rule : in the ith number, change the ith digit to a 7 if it isn\u2019t a 7, and change it to a 1 if it is a 7. \n\nWorking down the list, we now have a number that isn\u2019t the same as the first number (the first digit is different). It\u2019s not the same as the second number, since the second digit is different. In fact, following this line of reasoning, we\u2019ve built a number that differs in at least one place from every number in our list; hence, our list is missing a number. A contradiction.\n\nDoes that make more sense?"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Yes, I completely understand the process of the diagonal thing, how you obtain that number that is supposedly different from all the other numbers you had. My point is, because natural numbers are also infinite, you will always also have one natural to pair this new real number with.\n\nLet's imagine this is not true. It would mean we'd now have a number we cannot list. A number we have no natural numbers left to pair with. That's completely nonsensical. Natural numbers are infinite, meaning there is no end, it isn't possible to run out."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "&gt;It would mean we'd now have a number we cannot list.\n\nNo, it means that given our list (which we assumed was complete), we have found a number which is not on that list. That's what leads to the contradiction. There's a difference. \n\nRemember the expanded definition of \"being the same size:\" A set X is the same size as a set Y if there exists a bijection between them. A bijection is just a way to match up elements one - to -one. We have shown using the diagonal argument that, given any \"matching up\" of integers and reals, we can always find a new real number that wasn't in the original list. We cannot just add it to the list, because each natural number already has its unique real number pair, even though there are infinitely many of them.

Scientists change their minds all the time whether or not two particular breeds of animals are a distinct species or not. \n\nMeanwhile with breeding it really only matters to people who use animals for a particular purpose.

If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth, the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status, a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.[136] During the House debate, a fourth option, to retain its present form of commonwealth (sometimes referred to as \"the status quo\") political status, was added as an option in the second plebiscite.[136][137]\n\nSo there you have it.

That applies whether you're working at Walmart or a tech startup or anything else. This works to your benefit because when they're giving raises or promotions or whatever, they're going to give them to the person that is adding value.\n\nFor instance, suppose your options are limited due to a lack of higher education or experience. You get hired at Wendy's. Not ideal, and an easy job to not care about. Most of the other employees don't care. But instead, you take it seriously. You show up on time, your uniform is always clean, you don't get complaints, you volunteer for more hours when people want to take time off, etc. You develop a reputation of being reliable. A position opens up to become assistant manager. You get the job due to that reputation. You do that for a year. Now you can apply for other jobs with an assistant manager credential on your resume.

Both the Bible and Quran tell of Adam and Eve, Abraham, Moses, and all the other fun old testament stories we know from Sunday school.  The difference is just that where Christians believe Jesus was the son of God, Muslims believe he was fully human but one in a long line of prophets chosen by God, like Abraham and Moses.  Mohamad was the last prophets sent to clarify prior revelations.  \n\nMohamad was not an uncommon name in pre Islamic Arabia, much like Jesus (Yeshua/Joshua) was not an uncommon name in ancient Palestine.  To ban either name would be silly, like Mormons banning the name Joe on account of Joseph Smith or Scientologists banning the name Ron on account of L Ron Hubbard.  \n\nSo most of Christianity and Islam is the same, though told and interpreted differently.  One example is the second commandment to hold no graven images.  This is a bit vague.  Christians interpret this as do not worship images of God as though they were God.  Though even this is up for debate.  One of the major points of contention in the great schism between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches was the interpretation of idolatry.  Likewise some Protestants still object to Catholic veneration of icons of the saints as a violation of this commandment.  It's no different between Muslims and Christians.

It's almost as difficult for us as 3D creatures to imagine the world of 2D creatures as it is for us to understand the world of 4D creatures.\n\nOne way to try to visualise this is to imagine \"showing\" q 3D cube to a flatlander.  You might do this by slowly passing the cube through their 2D world.  It would be a bit like slicing the cube up into thin layers, and letting them look at each shape, then try and get them to imagine the cube.  But the layers the see change a lot depending on how you align the cube.\n\nStart with the cube flat.  As you lower it through their world, they'd see nothing, nothing, nothing, and then suddenly a square would appear.  Then this square would stay for a while as you lower the cube, and then it would vanish.  So, from their perspective, a cube is just a square.\n\nOkay, now you angle it so one edge is along the ground.  This time, they'd see a straight line that expands to a rectangle, maybe moves a bit depending on what angle the cube is as, then shrinks back to a line and vanishes.  Okay, so a cube is also rectangular.\n\nNow the fun one.  Suppose you lower it corner first.  They'd see a dot, then a triangle, which grows, until suddenly the corners vanish and it becomes a hexagon.  Then this becomes a regular hexagon.  The it starts to go the other way.  Corners appear again and you have a triangle, except this one is facing the other way.  Then this shrinks back to a dot.\n\nSo, flatlander is trying to imagine a shape that's a square, rectangle, triangle, and hexagon all in one.  That's not that easy!  Besides, did you even know that a cube had a perfect hexagon hidden inside?\n\nTrying to visualise 4D is similar.  A tesseract (4D version of a cube) that \"falls through 3D\" might look like a cube inside a cube, or a cube beside a cube, in particular orientations and position.  But trying to understand how it rotates in 4D is a mental nightmare.

That 2D shadow is sort of cube-like, but not exactly.\n\nLet's try this.  One of the common pictures of a tesseract looks like a small cube inside a big cube, with a wire from each corner of the big one to the corner of the small one.  The thing is, even though the 3D cubes appear different sizes, each one is actually the same size in 4D.  Every straight line in the illustration is the same length in 4D.  Plus, it looks like there's a sort of truncated pyramid stuck to each face of the small cube, and the bases of these 6 shapes form the big cube.  Well, those truncated pyramids in 3D are actually cubes in 4D.  Which just feels weird.  The 'inside' cube looks smaller because it's further away in the 4th dimension.\n\nHow does this relate to 2D/3D?  Well, take a wireframe cube and take a picture of it from close up.  What you'll see is a square inside a square, with diagonals connecting the corners.  It looks like the lines are all different lengths, but each is the exact same in 3D.  It's just that some are further away than others.  And, it also looks like each edge of the small square has a trapezium attached, and these trapeziums (trapezia?) form the bigger square.  But we know that each of those trapeziums is actually a *square* face of the 3D cube."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Okay, I get it now. So it all depends on the level of perception one is allowed depending on which dimension he's in. The tesseract is what a 4D cube's shadow would look to us, same as what a *3D* cube would look to 2D. It *is* a mental nightmare lol. But thanks for your explanation!\n\nHow far have humans understood 4D using Math and Physics compared to visuals or verbal analogies?"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "Dealing with 4D mathematically isn't much trickier than dealing with 3D.  Pythagoras, for example.  In 2D, we'd say the distance between 2 points is given by d=\u221a(x\u00b2+y\u00b2).  In 3D, it's just d=\u221a(x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2).  Well, the 4D version where w is the length in the 4th dimension is just d=\u221a(w\u00b2+x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2).\n\nI could give you a game of 4D tic-tac-toe.  You need a bigger grid (because 3x3 is already easy), say 4x4x4x4.  And it's tricky to keep track of things, but mathematically it's relatively simple.  You'd just draw a 4x4 grid of 4x4 grids.  Going down each column of grids would be like going down a 3D stack.  Going along each row of grids is similar but through the 4th dimension.\n\nThere are other situations where 4D maths makes things easier or is even necessary.  Complex numbers work in 2D.  If you don't know what they are, that's a whole different discussion.  But the TLDR is basically that there's what we call the real part which is like the x-axis, and then the imaginary part, which is just a number multiplied by the imaginary number i, and is like moving along the y-axis.  We tried a 3D version with 2 imaginary numbers i and j at right angles, so j would be like the z axis.  But the system just didn't make sense.  Then, someone realised it *does* work in 4D using a third imaginary number k.  This is what we call quaternions.  They're relatively easy to work with and are how computers deal with rotations in 3D.  But it can be really hard to visualise what the mean as 4D numbers."}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mm0tj9/eli5_how_in_the_hell_does_the_4th_dimension_work/", "post_id": "mm0tj9"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: In movies when people are dying, the person that cares for them tells them not to waste energy talking, is it realistic for that last little amount of energy spent talking to be the difference between life and death?"}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "My mom was in hospice for 6 days.

No one considered them left wing, even though they had a lot of socialist elements present. \n\nPart of the issue in this discussion is that there are multiple terms that are sometimes used to mean the same thing, and sometimes used to mean different things. \n\nFor example, if we were to use the traditional 2D political chart with the Authoritarian-Libertarian axis describing how strong the government is, and the Left-Right axis describing the economic system, then the Nazi Party would be Authoritarian and Centrist to center-left on the economic spectrum. In this case, Left solely refers to economic system. However, this makes the Nazi Party seem like it was just short of the Communist Party of the USSR. You could certainly make the argument that they *were/are* the same thing, yet most people would say that the Nazi Party and other fascists were right-wing, while the Communists were left-wing. \n\nThis gets into the fact that left and right wing can be and are often used to refer to **multiple measures.** \n\nWe can say that Communists and Nazis/Fascists were both Authoritarian in that they supported a really strong state. We can say that they were both  Communists and Nazis/Fascists had planned economies and thus were on the left of the economic spectrum.\n\nHowever, we can say that the actual policies and goals of the two groups were extremely different. The USSR, at least under Lenin, was internationalist and multi-ethnic, with the goal of eliminating classes. They killed off the monarchy and the aristocracy. Under Hitler, Germany was nationalist and an ethno-state, with the goal of establishing new classes based on race.

The problem with influenza viruses is that they tend to mutate too fast for vaccination programs to keep up. This is why you need to take a yearly influenza vaccine because the vaccine you got last year was for a set of viruses which have now mutated. The yearly influenza vaccine still have a massive impact on the number of people who die from influenza but we are not able to get herd immunity before the influenza viruses mutate.\n\nBut the vaccine technology that have being used for the first time now to make a vaccine against COVID-19 is specifically designed to be much faster to develop. Instead of taking months between a new mutation of an influenza virus to be discovered until full scale vaccine production is under way we are now looking at more like two weeks. So if this technique gets approved for other influenza viruses as well then we might see the yearly influenza vaccine become much more efficient as it will be targeting the newest mutations that is spreading through the population right from the start.

Maybe I got the story wrong, so I'll just take your word for it for the sake of discussion.\n\nIt sounds like we're saying the same thing--Europeans and Native Americans had different immune systems due to what diseases they had been exposed to. But I'm puzzled why you'd think that those differences were a racial difference.  \"Race\" implies a genetic, heritable difference, one that is innate to a person and to all of the people of the same race. But the immunity to disease is an acquired, environmental difference. It doesn't derive from having Native American ancestry. If a newborn Native American were teleported to Europe in 1600 and raised there, that individual would likely have the same disease immunity that a person of Germany ancestry. And if a newborn Irish kid had been teleported to 1600 American continent, they'd almost certainly die along with 90-95% of the Native American  inhabitants of the eastern US in the plague that occurred in that time and place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I don't understand the need to go about arguing that we're all the same exact thing. A fair white person will sunburn more easily than a dark black person. Does this example not suffice that we're biologically different? Why do I have to start listing out examples until we find one that works. You must firmly believe that we are physiologically identical to each other, otherwise you wouldn't make me go through such trouble for debate.\n\nI think you're misrepresenting the position of people who are saying that race is a cultural, not biological, construct. No one is arguing that a white person and a black person react the same to the sun. What they're saying is that the criteria that are ascribed to divide people into different groups are false; that the distinct categorizations of peoples into races does not reflect true biological differences. There are only a few genes that are given enormous significance in categorizing people into different groups. All kinds of traits are ascribed to each race that there's zero evidence exist or are related to things like skin color or eye shape or  hair texture. Furthermore, race doesn't in any way accurately divide people into groups in the way it purports to do. And these traits used are based on things that are important in a particular culture. Then, in the way of culture, things that are important are said to be unchanging and innate--this makes the culture more stable. Change can be confusing and stressful so saying that this is just the way things are, and that the way I personally see the world is unambiguously, completely accurately, THE way the world IS, is comforting. \n\nBut there are a lot more genetic differences within a given race than between different races. Also, virtually all humans who are descended from people from outside sub-Saharan Africa are quite similar, as compared to the differences between any 2 people of different villages in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, modern humans, it seems, evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then a small subset of those people left Africa and populated the rest of the planet. All the differences you see among Europeans, Native Americans, Asians, etc., all come from this small subset of people that left Africa.  Meanwhile, most genetic variation stayed in Africa. \n\nSo if your purpose in using the concept of race to divide people into different groups is that you feel that it's simply a fact that all the people of a given race are pretty similar and share a bunch of traits, then that's false. The genetics show that you get more genetic variation in 2 people of different but neighboring villages in Africa, than you do between someone of Irish ancestry and someone from an Amazonian tribe in Brazil or someone from Japan, despite the vast geographical distances and visual differences. On the basis of genetic similarity, you'd have to make each village or tribe in Africa into its own separate race numbering in the thousands, and everyone else in the world from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego into one single race. That scheme bears zero resemblance to the way race is typically defined in the world today, in which people generally say that all Africans are black.\n\nYou don't like that way of dividing people into race? OK, then let's think of other criteria to use to divide people into races. How about we base it only on appearance and the very few genes that control appearance, like skin color, hair texture, eye color, and some elements of facial features. First of all that's a bit weird because you're ignoring the zillions of genes in the body and placing extreme importance on just a few genes--it's like if you decide that everything that is green is a tree, and everything that is brown is a mushroom. No, it's not. Are trees and mushrooms different? Yes. Are we ignoring their differences and saying they're the same if we say that dividing everything into mushrooms and trees is a bad way of dividing things? No. Differences are still acknowledged, it's just that that particular schema is wrong.  \n\nSo what is the value in dividing people into races based on their skin color? Why is that an important thing to do? But let's accept that it matters, for the sake of argument. Then where do you draw your dividing lines? Humans don't fall into distinct groups as if they're separate islands of people that never interact. Humans breed with people who live near them, historically. While it's very obvious that Swedish woman Elin Nordegren and South African man Nelson Mandela look extremely different, what are the borders of each of the races they are ascribed to? People tend to look fairly similar to those around them. There's a gradual gradient of skin color from far from the equator to the equator. There's no natural barrier, no absolute factor that separates one race from another. This has led to dumb tests people have used to ascribe race--like the paper bag test (darker than the paper bag equals black, lighter than the paper bag equals white) or the fine toothed comb test (if your hair is too curly to run a fine-toothed comb through, then you're black). Or the one-drop rule. These are all \\*culturally determined\\* tests used to ascribe race to a person, there's no biological basis for them. \n\nSo let's choose a different way of dividing people into races. How about we look at genes via DNA companies like 23andMe. Do those tests divide people into races? No, they don't. In fact, they show that everyone is a mixture of traits found at different frequencies in different regions of the world. They base their determinations on tendencies--like this particular gene is found mostly in this particular group. But the gene is really found across a vast swathe of the world. It's just more common in one area than another. The mitochondrial DNA that is the most common mDNA for Europeans to have, is even more common in an area of North Africa. How does that convey race? It doesn't. It conveys human differences and similarities in one criterium. Human differences don't equal different races. There are millions of different genes, and almost all of them are being ignored in favor of enormous importance placed on just a few genes as a means of categorizing people. And the few genes that are paid attention to as ways to categorize people aren't inherently any more important than other genes, but they are CULTURALLY important, because our culture has decided to place enormous importance on those genes."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Very long wall of text, but I appreciate the time you took to write it for me.\n\nFrom the way that you put it, it seems like it\u2019s almost impossible to start categorizing all of humankind taxonomically. I gather that this is such a large task because we are all so similar. That no one is saying we are identical, but our differences are very, very small. \n\nI guess the only question I have left for you is to suppose there were no cultural importance placed on certain genes and we were able to look at ourselves like the animals we technically are, is there a case to be made for classifying us then\u2014 maybe consider the ones doing the classifying are aliens just observing us, with no stake in the matter.

The British wanted to drive imports to China, which at the time had such a massive trade deficit with Britain, centered around tea, that 30% of total *world* production of silver went to China, largely via British trade. In response to British inquiries, the emperor sent possibly the most monumentally dickish diplomatic letter in written history to Britain, declaring that there was nothing of value that the Brits could *possibly* provide his obviously superior nation, and the Brits should be glad that he was gracing them with trade in the first place. This miffed the Brits. So, they began intentionally importing opium into China in massive quantities as economic sabotage (by \"they\", I mean the British East India Company, which was essentially married to the British gov't). The Chinese quickly got addicted in massive numbers, and this angered the emperor. The emperor, with internal decrees proving ineffective (addiction is a helluva drug) and a couple of half-hearted diplomatic requests falling on deaf British ears, responded by seizing *all* opium in Guangdong (major port city), even opium in foreign possession. All in all, about 1500 tons (yep, tons). This angered the Brits, and they ~~declared war~~ initiated military means to secure reparations for seized cargo. China lost that war. In the ensuing Treaty of Nanking, they lost Hong Kong, and ceded spheres of influences to multiple foreign powers. China's GDP was cut in half over the course of both Opium Wars and the ensuing Taiping Rebellion.  \n\n2. \"By the time the civil war came to a close\" - this likely refers to the Taiping Rebellion, which was triggered by the economic effects of the Opium Wars. Somewhere around 20-30 million people died in it.  \n\nThe period beginning with the First Opium War is generally known as China's \"century of humiliation.\" It went from the largest GDP on the planet, by a *wide* margin, to a poor, third-world country.

Gaseous steam has the potential to absorb a lot of that energy, so you want to absorb as much of it as possible.Of course, there is a huge burst of power when liquid water is converted to a gas. However once it is converted to a gas, it still has the potential to expand more from absorbing heat. If you constrain the gas so it cannot expand, the pressure goes up. The turbines that convert the gas energy into a spinning shaft operate off of the difference in pressure between the inlet and the outlet. I phrase it that way so I can add a fascinating bit about the stages of energy drawn off by the turbine sets. You'd think the steam would be passed through a large single turbine, but there are often more of them in series. \n\nA fairly common arrangement on a ship would be a small high-pressure turbine, then the exhaust is directed to a large medium-pressure turbine. (medium-pressure acting on large turbine blades produce the same shaft torque as high-pressure acting on small turbine blades). Fairly low pressure steam (still a gas) comes out the exhaust.\n\nHere's the wacky part. After the steam reaches the end of the line (farther down), it is cooled to condense it back into hot liquid water. The chamber in which the steam condenses into liquid will draw a partial vacuum. Do we throw that vacuum away? We direct it to a third huge turbine, where low-pressure steam is directed to the inlet, and the partial vacuum is directed to the outlet to \"suck\" the turbine into spinning."}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/c8tbcz/eli5_why_cant_we_use_materials_with_lower_boiling/", "post_id": "c8tbcz"}, {"dialogue": [{"author": "explainee", "text": "ELI5: what Apple\u2019s child-exploitation prevention efforts do, and what information is sent where, how, and under what circumstances."}, {"author": "explainer", "text": "*Today*"}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "Well yes things can change at a moments notice.

I think it is more intuitive to think of a piston in an internal combustion engine: the fuel is ignited and its volume/pressure increases, the force of the pressure pushes on the piston which is moving in a direction, that is work transferring energy from the pressure of the gas to the motion of the piston while the pressure is decreasing as the volume expands.\n\nThe temperature does not do the work; work is the integral of force along a distance."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "&gt;The temperature does not do the work; work is the integral of force along a distance.\n\nYeah this is exactly what I mean.

At least for me, it makes it a bit more intuitive to think about because it does not involve heating/cooling and phase changes. The same fundamental energy transfers apply to both though. \n\nSince we agree that temperature does not matter, I won't mention it again.\n\nThe act of boiling the water increases the pressure of the gas, this is analogous to pushing down on the plunger of a bike pump to increase the pressure of the gas. Now, imagine you have a little valve you can open to release a stream of that pressurized gas and shoot it at a pinwheel to make it spin. The pressure of the gas in the pump drops as it passes through the valve (and the gas speeds up), then that fast stream of gas smacks into the pinwheel and makes it spin (while the gas slows down in the process). \n\nYou then have to collect that gas and spend some energy to bring it back to the initial conditions so you can repeat the cycle. The useful work you get out is the difference between the work the gas does on the turbine and the work you have to put back in to reset the system.\n\nSame thing is happening in a closed water cycle with turbines and condensers. \n\nIn this analogy, you could imagine two differently designed pumps, where one stroke on each creates a different pressure at the outlet. Can think of a big ass pump a foot in diameter vs a tiny ass pump an inch diameter. One stroke on each will produce a different output.\n This is somewhat analogous to the difference between water or acetone. For any given material, a given input of energy will boil a given mass of the material and result in a given change in the pressure of the gas.\n\nTaking it to the extreme end of poor performance, an imaginary material that boiled into a gas of the same volume as the liquid would not produce any change in pressure. It would not turn the turbine at all, but you would still have to cool it down again to reset the cycle ending up with a negative efficiency. \n\nSo again, it is the change in pressure that drives the whole process. Water just happens to be efficient for producing large changes in pressure between the liquid and vapor phases for a given input of energy.   In a perfect world, we would have some material that suddenly expands to a gas of 10 million times the liquid volume with very little heat input and is non-toxic and cheap and all of this happens near room temperature.

How about farts? Both of those occurrences are gases that has either: found its way past those meat-gates somehow - for example, say, from swallowing soda too fast - or gases that are released by our microscopic Gundam pilots from their every day lives. What we eat usually gets pushed past two of those gates to get to our processing facilities - our stomach - namely the upper and lower esophageal sphincters.  \n\nWhen we swallow, the length of \"hose\" - the esophagus - that connects your face-mounted food hole to the processing facility, kind of does The Wave to scoot all the mooshed up noms from the entrance^mouth to the exit^stomach. That Wave - which has a fancy name because scientists are dorks; \"peristalsis\" - normally lets those gates know to open up for a moment to let supplies through. Once the supplies reach the second processing facility^your ^stomach, some of the pilots and their homies start sorting out the important junk. In this facility, they use a slightly weakened type of acid to help; but don't worry, the facility's walls are *supposed* to be soaked in snot, which prevents the acid from messing up the walls (sometimes, the acid finds a spot that ain't got snot, which leads to other issues, but that's another topic.)  \n\nDuring the processing, those meat-gates typically stay shut tight so the acid don't leak into unprotected areas; *unfortunately,* some supplies react with the acid and produce a bit of \"air,\" and some of the pilots start \"breathing\" heavily while they work, which fills the room with more air than it can handle. When the room has too much air in it, our meat-mech lets the neck buttholes relax a bit so the air can get out. This storage facility is closer to the entrance than the exit, so the air usually escapes through your face holes - we call this event a burp.  \n\nUnder normal circumstances, those gates stay shut tight to keep the acid, supplies, pilots, their homies, and snot inside the room. Once that facility has processed the supplies best it can, the suit opens another gate that leads the supplies to further processing facilities towards the exit. This gate is part of a series of gates that works kind of like a spaceship's airlock; the supplies are still thoroughly soaked in acid, which *can* damage the other facilities, so the acid needs to be either removed, or weakened further. Removing the acid takes a bit more work than the pilots in this area feel like they're paid for, so they borrow some liquid \"baking soda\" to neutralize the acid (it works a bit like mixing baking soda and vinegar; the soda is made of certain stuff that likes to grab ahold of some of the stuff the acid is made of. The soda yoinks this stuff, and holds on to it; this effectively \"breaks\" the acid, making some other crap that won't damage the other facilities.)  \n\nEverything after that is just passing from one gated room to the next, each room's pilots gradually becoming more picky about what they want to take, until it gets close to the exit. Near the exit, a whole other crew of maintenance workers yoink as much water/leftover goodies from the supplies as they can, before stapling a bunch of other ^literal crap they don't want littering the mech, and lines it up at the exit gate for quick disposal whenever too much builds up. When there's enough crap lying around, someone hits the \"gotta Dookie!\" button, and you - hopefully - find a good place to eject it!  \n\n***Tl;dr -*** thankfully there's a *bunch* of gates and security protocols that're designed to keep the stuff you put in to your mech, in; this includes a bunch of funky smells, steam, or \"body odor\" that your microscopic crew produce while dismantling various supplies. Sometimes too much air, too many supplies, or some supplies your crew doesn't want to deal with (picky fartknockers) has to gtfo before processing is complete, at which point the crew either pushes it back up to the entrance (burps, puking/regurgitation, acid reflux/\"heartburn,\") or rushes it to the exit (farts, dookie, dookie-floods/diarrhea,) depending on which hole is closest.  \n\nIt would kind of suck if we didn't have those gates, and we could smell *everything* that goes on down there. On the other hand, food that is too physically hot does alert your mech to turn on defensive measures, one of which being flood the area with slime/enzymes to wash away any harmful \"aliens\" that could invade, if the heat were to damage the outer barriers (flesh.) That's why some burns can cause a blister; the body thinks the outer layer was damaged enough for \"aliens\" to get in, so it rushes fluid/micro-soldiers to the site. If the barrier wasn't broken, it gets trapped between the inner and outer walls, and makes a bubble we call a blister.  \n\n...

The main character will usually get more development because they are a main character. I thought that was understood?\n\nIm just expanding the definition to include exceptions. Sure extra characters usually dont have much character development but ive seen a few extras have tons of character development. Just because you are a side character doesnt mean you dont get development. Thats a double standard (i think i used that term correctly). Its the same for a main character. Just because you are a main character doesnt mean you will always get development.\n\nRather than looking at the characters importance in the story first, i think acknowledging they are a character first, and a main character second is better. After youve acknowledged that you are looking at a character that might or might not be a main character, you should look at the characters complexity. And then after that, you should look at the characters importance and how that ties to the characters complexity and relationship to the plot.\n\nAlso on the topic of stereotypes, yes they usually are boring, repetitive and lacking in character development, i often see characters that follow a stereotype to the t and still be amazing characters. Sometimes its because they fill a stereotype they are great characters. Sometimes the stereotype is just a bonus to an already great character. \n\nSummary: First, although your summary is sometimes correct, that doesnt make it true for all stories. In fact im probably missing a few parts to my summary/definition. Second, Characters that dont have development *can* be side characters but they arent always side characters. Characters that do have a lot of development *can* be main characters but they arent always main characters. (Squares and rectangles if you want me to explain it as if you are 5). Third, characters are characters before they are stereotypes and characters can have development even if they are stereotypes. \n\nSummary for my summary (bc i realized that its way too long and also bc im like that) : Characters are characters before they are anything, before they are main characters, side characters, stereotypes, etc. And all characters can have a different amount of dimensions based on their complexity."}, {"author": "explainee", "text": "A side character is entirely different from an extra.

That makes quite a bit of sense now, thanks.\" If thats not what im saying then either i didnt do a very good job or no offense your blind. One of comments talked about a few of those factors.

My explaination is based off the assumption that people will usually care more about characters that have more development. Its also based off the assumption that *usually* more important characters will usually have more complexity meaning complex characters are often main characters (but *not always*). The dimensions of a character is solely based off the complexity of a character.

Ofcourse non complex characters can have charactistics that make them different from others but sometimes those characters feel like they have those characteristics just to be different rather than to be a good character. Another factor is the characters back story or their history. The history of a characters should support why they are who they are. Examples could vary from a characters parents were killed by a criminal so the character wants to hunt down criminals to a character thats was kind to another character when they were a child so the character tries to be kind to everyone because of that.

An important definition of death is its irreversibility. Second, whilst breathing is affected, volatile anesthetics (the ones you breathe in, as opposed to ones that are injected) tend not to cause complete cessation of breathing. But more importantly, anesthetics for surgery are not given at such high levels to cease brain activity. In fact, some people do sleep and do dream under anaesthesia! Very deep levels of anaesthesia are reserved for when a patient has seizures that can't stop (status epilepticus). As an aside, even deep levels of anaesthesia can't treat the rare disease of familial insomnia - a fatal disease where patients just cannot fall asleep at all.
